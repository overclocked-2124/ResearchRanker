Abstract: 
The 
relationship 
between 
electricity 
price and 
household 
solar photovoltaic (PV) adoption has not been thoroughly studied. How much would a 
carbon tax, and increase in electricity price, spur growth in residential solar? This 
paper adds to the literature with a utility-level panel analysis. Consumer choice provides 
the framework for the empirical models. I use electricity price and net metered solar PV 
capacity data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Through a variety of 
specifications, I control for both utility and state-year effects. My findings suggest that 
electricity price is significantly positively correlated with solar adoption, with an 
estimated price elasticity of 1.85. These results are limited by endogeneity bias.

I. Introduction 
Over the last decade, solar photovoltaic (PV) installations grew 40 to 60% 
annually (SEIA and GTM 2016). This growth is expected to continue as the U.S. 
Department of Energy (2016) projects rooftop solar could power up to 39% of U.S. 
electricity. Compared to grid-level solar, distributed solar, or residential PV systems, 
expand community energy sovereignty and allow households to get off the grid and know 
from where their electricity is generated. Rapidly falling solar prices and new renewable 
energy incentives have made residential solar PV a more affordable option for the 
average household. But in a possible future with fewer policy incentives, it is important 
for policymakers and economists to understand what other factors drive demand for solar 
PV and what are the best ways to incentivize investments? We can look at the alternative 
cost of solar, electricity prices, which are expected to rise due to decommissioning coal, 
renewable mandates, and unpredictable natural gas price trends, in the case of California 
(Vartabedian 2014). To what extent do electricity prices inform and incentivize residential 
solar energy investments? From a policy perspective, how much would a carbon tax, and 
subsequent increase in electricity price, spur growth in residential solar energy 
investments? This paper empirically analyzes these questions. 
The literature examines a wide range of factors that influence residential solar 
energy demand. First, the upfront cost of the solar PV system is critical to the household’s 
investment decision. Solar panel prices have dropped 63% since 2011 due to increased 
competition in the U.S. market, technological improvements, and growth in Chinese 
silicon-based solar panel manufacturing (SEIA and GTM 2016). Across the U.S. solar 
prices vary; greater installer density decreases solar prices, while higher consumer value of 
 
 
3
solar increases solar prices (Gillingham et al. 2016). Federal and state incentive programs, 
like subsidies and tax credits, significantly reduce the upfront cost of solar PV, directly 
affecting household investment decisions and making residential solar economically 
efficient (Borenstein 2015). Sarzynski et al. (2012) find that states with renewable portfolio 
standards, or clean energy goals and strategies, have 95% higher solar adoption rates 
than those without; and, states with cash incentives have 248% higher solar deployment 
than those without. 
Another program that reduces costs and incentivizes household solar investment is 
net metering. With these programs, households connect their solar PV systems to the 
grid, and receive compensation for the excess electricity generated and transmitted to that 
grid. States either mandate all utilities to offer these programs, do not mandate at all, or 
enact red tape policies like extra charges or system size caps that limit the maximum 
value of program benefits for the household. The literature does not find much influence 
of net metering policy in adoption rates (Sarzynski et al. 2012, DOE 2014), but net 
metering programs do increase returns on investment. In one study, 1/3 of the electricity 
generated in the sample was not consumed by the generators but flowed to the grid, so 
the returns on net metering are potentially influential (Borenstein 2015). These returns 
are directly related to electricity prices, as the household is compensated at a similar or 
equivalent rate. Thus, with higher electricity prices net metering compensation and 
overall benefits increase over the life of the solar PV investment.  
Wealthier households may have greater rates of adoption, as they can cover the 
upfront cost (Borenstein 2015), but other authors find no effects of household income on 
adoption (Durham et al. 1988), and others identify weak correlation between income and 
 
 
4
adoption (DOE 2014). Other state-level demographic characteristics, including number 
of household residents and education, are significantly influential in solar adoption 
(Durham et al. 1988), with education presumably increasing the knowledge and 
awareness required to determine the benefits of investment.  
The “energy efficiency paradox” is the observed phenomenon that energy-
efficient investments with high rates of return, like solar PV, are routinely passed by 
investors.1 This occurs due to lack of financial support or credit, perceived technological 
risk, transaction costs, information asymmetry, and above all, high discount rates 
(Alberini et al. 2013, Qiu et al. 2014, Faiers & Naeme 2006). In the presence of 
uncertainty, households value the high upfront cost more heavily than the slowly 
accumulating benefits in the future. Bauner & Crago (2015) find that in order to trigger 
household investment, discounted benefits must exceed investment costs by 60%. Hassett 
& Metcalf (1993) also find a high hurdle rate, or minimum savings, before investment in 
solar energy is profitable. The authors claim that policies geared to reduce initial 
investment costs, such as subsidies or a federal investment tax credit, must be matched 
with policies to increase benefits, such as taxes on energy consumption and electricity to 
raise costs of the alternative. Carbon taxes, for example, increase electricity prices, which 
raise the benefits of the solar panel over the lifetime of the investment, and encourage a 
household to invest. To examine the benefits of such a policy, we would need to know the 
extent to which changes in electricity price inform a household’s investment decision. 
                                                             
1 In another area of the literature, authors study household willingness to pay for renewable energy sources 
through premiums in their electricity bill. Authors find that these options are not significantly valued by 
consumers, with the exception of solar and locally generated power premiums (Gracia et al. 2012). Survey 
results suggest consumers value air emissions reductions and renewable energy, but this value is difficult to 
quantify (Roe et al. 2001).

Few papers examine how perceptions of electricity price and changes in price 
affect investment in residential solar.2 According to panel data analysis (Sarzynski et al. 
2012) and cross-sectional analysis (DOE 2014), states with higher electricity prices have 
higher rates of solar adoption. Durham et al. (1988) find that a 1% increase in 
conventional energy prices increases probability of solar water heater adoption by 1.28%, 
of significance comparable to tax credits. In a study of state financial incentives, Sarzynski 
et al. (2012) estimate that a 1% increase in electricity price increases grid-tied solar 
capacity by 2.27%. Chan et al. (2016) exploit the natural case study of an exogenous 
electricity price shock to measure household response in solar adoption. Nuclear power, 
which comprised 11% of Japan’s energy production in 2011, dropped to zero following 
the Fukushima nuclear disaster, causing 70% of companies to raise prices 20 to 30%. The 
authors find a one yen/kWh (equivalent to less than $0.01/kWh) increase, or 4% of 
observed electricity price, leads to 7900 more residential solar installations; this is about 
equal to a 39.5 MW increase in solar capacity per $0.01 increase in electricity price. They 
estimate a price elasticity, of 1.4 to 1.97, or a 1% increase in price yields a 1.4% to 1.97% 
increase in solar capacity, compared to Sarzynski et al. (2012) estimate of 2.03 to 2.27. 
Finally, Kwan (2012) analyzes the spatial distribution of solar PV arrays with a zip code 
level cross-section. The author observes a 21.7% increase in residential solar PV share 
(%) for every $1.00 increase in the price of electricity.  
                                                             
2 Economists have, however, studied the degree to which households change their electricity consumption 
in response to changes in price. Alberini et al. (2011) estimate price elasticities over a ten-year period and 
find a nationwide -0.67 to -0.86 elasticity, a weak demand response to price of electricity in short and long 
term. Many authors find low price elasticities of demand for electricity ranging in the short-term of -0.21 
and long-term of -0.61 (Labandeira et al. 2017), and one author identifies an even lower elasticity of -0.029, 
when estimating real-time price elasticities (Lijeson 2006). Wolak (2011) tests three dynamic pricing models: 
hourly pricing with a demand warning, critical peak pricing (CPP) with the same high price for 4 to 6 
hours, and CPP with a rebate. The author finds that consumers show sizable demand reductions and react 
similarly to all three pricing schemes.

These papers have a number of shortcomings. The effect of electricity prices is 
only the focus of one author’s empirical analysis (Chan et al. 2016), while others study 
electricity price as a control variable in a broader analysis. Thus, their model 
specifications and observation levels for analysis are not ideal for studying the influence of 
electricity prices. Cross-sectional analyses (DOE 2014, Kwan 2012) fail to account for 
differences in adoption across time. Second, studies that observe data at the state level 
(DOE 2014, Sarzynski et al. 2012) fail to incorporate the heterogeneity in electricity price 
within states, and across counties and utilities. For example, in my sample, with a national 
average electricity price of $0.12/kWh, prices in New York range from $0.03/kWh to 
$0.42/kWh. State-level analyses would be biased if the average state electricity price is 
not equivalent to the price the average household faces.  
My empirical analysis will address these shortcomings in four ways. First, with 
panel data analysis, my model will account for time variance, compared to cross-sectional 
studies. Given the variation in electricity prices within U.S. states, by observing data at 
the level of the electric utility, I can more closely reflect the prices households face and 
capture heterogeneity in electricity price within states. I will compare the results of my 
utility-level analysis to results of my aggregated state-level analysis to test for potential 
biases in studies using state level data. Third, using utility level data enables me to employ 
state and state-time effects to control for unobserved determinants of adoption that are 
potentially correlated with electricity prices and are specific to states, including state-level 
policies. If for example, a renewable energy mandate was enacted during my period of 
analysis, which was correlated with a subsequent rise in electricity prices due to higher 
utility costs, I can control for this effect on solar adoption without biasing my estimates.

Fourth, using a large sample of utilities enables me to generalize about the elasticity of 
electricity price on adoption of solar PV. The main contribution of my thesis will be to 
offer the advantages and disadvantages of using aggregated utility level data to study the 
influence of electricity prices on solar adoption. 
My findings suggest that electricity price is significantly positively correlated with 
solar adoption. In the preferred specification, a log-level utility fixed effects model with 
state-year interaction terms, a $0.01/kWh increase in electricity price (national average is 
$0.12/kWh) increases installed capacity by 5.54%; the price elasticity of demand is 1.85. 
These estimates assume I have addressed omitted variable bias and endogeneity 
problems; however, my utility level analysis fails to account for the omitted variable, solar 
price, which strongly influences solar adoption and is negatively correlated with electricity 
price, causing endogeneity bias. 
This paper is organized as follows: First, I use consumer choice theory, and 
literature on forecasting and discounting, to provide a framework for understanding 
residential solar demand. Section III provides the empirical models for my utility and 
state-level analyses. Section IV examines my data, including retail electricity prices and 
net metered solar PV capacity from Energy Information Administration (EIA). Section V 
uses a variety of specifications to estimate the effect of electricity prices on the growth of 
residential solar PV. Finally, I conclude in Section VII and VIII with a discussion of my 
results and remarks on future research and policy implications.

II. Theory 
 
To measure the degree to which electricity prices inform residential solar energy 
investment decisions, we must first understand the household’s decision. Economic theory 
models households’ decisions as utility maximization. Households choose among bundles 
of goods and services based on benefits and costs, and consume the bundle that provides 
the greatest utility given their income. In the case of the decision to invest in solar PV, the 
household first chooses their optimal consumption of energy, in relation to all other 
goods. Next, households choose to consume this energy from one of two sources: solar 
energy, from investing and installing a PV system, or grid electricity, from paying electric 
utility bills. The decision is determined by comparing the present value of costs of grid 
electricity in equation [1] with the present value of costs of solar PV in equation [2].  
The cost of grid electricity from the electric utility, Celectric, is the retail rate, Pgrid in 
dollars per kilowatt hour (kWh), multiplied by the consumption of electricity, Q*, in 
kilowatt hours. The retail rate of electricity varies across U.S. states, and across U.S. 
utilities within states. This rate is determined both by state regulations through Public 
Service Commissions, and by market forces that affect demand and supply. Supply forces 
include generation, transmission, and distribution costs, like weather or fuel costs, while 
demand depends on the demographics of the utility's customers, such as income level and 
rural versus urban home sizes (EIA 2015).  
The cost of solar PV, Csolar , is the cost of the residential solar PV system minus the 
benefits of bill savings, net metering, and additional utility. The cost of the solar PV 
panels, Cpanel, is the cost of installing and purchasing the PV system, which is affected by 
subsidies, tax credits, solar panel prices, and installation costs which vary by location.

After installing the PV system, the household generates their own electricity, G, and 
incurs a benefit of no longer paying utility bills for household energy consumption. This 
benefit, Bbill, is equal to the price of electricity times quantity consumed, Pgrid ´ Q*. The 
energy that is not consumed, G-Q*, is fed to the grid and compensated through state net 
metering programs. Utilities pay the household credits equal to the price of grid 
electricity, Pgrid , for this excess energy, which has a total benefit, Bnem , equal to Pgrid ´ (G-
Q*). The total benefits are thus equal to Pgrid ´ G. In addition, some households receive an 
intangible benefit, or utility, from getting off the grid and being more sustainable; this is 
indicated by U.  
The present discounted cost of grid electricity [1] and present discounted cost of 
solar [2] are the sum of costs over 25 years, the average lifespan of solar PV system and 
what many manufacturers cover under warranty (DOE 2012, Sherwani et al. 2010), and 
functions of discounting and forecasting. The two cost equations are as follows:

These equations model the alternative approach to risk accounting created by 
Thompson (1997). Instead of incorporating risk into models simply by raising the 
discount rate, the author models the household decision as between two future cash 
streams filled with uncertainty. In the electricity cash stream [1], households pay 
electricity bills according to their electricity consumption and the utility’s electricity price. 
In the solar cash stream [2], households pay the upfront cost and receive uncertain 
benefits of bill savings and net metering over the life of the solar panel. Because all of 
these costs and benefits are paid or received in the future, the household discounts by 
dividing future values by (1+r)t  where r is the discount rate and t is the number of years 
since installation.  
Estimates of discount rates vary in the literature. In the absence of asymmetric 
information and uncertainty, discount rates should be equal to the real interest rate; they 
measure the return on investment or opportunity cost. In this case, discount rates would 
differ between households depending on access to credit. One of the first papers to 
identify high implicit discount rates in energy-using durables investments, Hausman 
(1979), models individual air conditioner purchase decisions. The author estimates a 
consumer discount rate between 15% to 25%, comparable to the average interest rate for 
credit cards at the time, 18%. This rate accounts for the tradeoff between present purchase 
price and future operating costs, energy efficiency benefits, and durability benefits. Enzler 
et al. (2014) measure subjective discount rates and identify rates as high as 60%, but they 
do not find convincing evidence that these discount rates impact energy saving behavior. 
In contrast, Alberini et al. (2013) identify a low discount rate of 1.5 to 2.9%, after 
removing uncertainty from survey scenarios. Overall, discount rates vary in the literature; 
 
 
11 
yet, the underlying consumer beliefs and perceptions that determine a discount rate are 
important to understand when theorizing solar adoption. 
The costs described in equation [1] and [2] are expected (E) in that the household 
must predict future electricity prices over the 25-year time period to estimate the sum of 
present benefits and costs before making the investment. Anderson et al. (2011) find that 
the average consumer expects future real gasoline prices to be the same as the current 
price. This suggests that the undervaluation of fuel economy investments, or energy 
efficiency investments, does not stem from energy price biases. Allcott (2011) finds that 
consumers incorrectly calculate energy costs and savings due to imperfect information. Of 
the author’s surveyed consumers, 40% did not think about fuel costs at all, while 89% of 
those who did calculated imprecisely. This study agrees with Alberini et al. (2013) which 
suggests that households uncertain about future energy prices weigh the cost of energy 
efficiency retrofits more heavily than the benefits. Although these studies focus on 
consumer forecasting of gasoline prices, they are the best available reference as few studies 
examine consumer forecasting of electricity prices. 
 
Provided these cost equations, as long as households value the future benefits to 
the same degree as the costs, an increase in the price of electricity, Pgrid, causes benefits of 
solar to rise, and the cost of solar, Csolar, to become relatively cheaper. At the same time, 
the cost of electricity, Celectric, becomes relatively more expensive. The likelihood the cost of 
solar will be lower than the cost of electricity rises; that is, the household’s demand for 
solar rises. Market demand for solar is the sum of all individual demands at all prices. 
To measure the influence of the price of electricity, the focus of this thesis, my 
empirical models must control for other factors within the solar market that affect how 
 
 
12 
the equilibrium quantity of solar changes. Price changes occur based on the availability of 
state and federal subsidies and tax credits, and changing costs of PV systems. Demand for 
solar shifts due to changes in income, preferences, or education of solar energy, 
population, and expectations. The supply of solar shifts due to changes in input prices, 
technologies that affect installation or production procedures, firm entry or exit. Both 
supply and demand are also affected by insolation that measures potential capacity of 
solar given amount of sunlight.  
III. Empirical Models  
The ideal empirical model for my analysis measures adoption of residential solar 
energy as a function of all the factors influencing supply, demand, and price changes in 
the market for solar energy. Many of these factors are recorded at the state or household 
level, but I am observing data at the utility level to best match the electricity prices 
households face. Because of this, I control for state-level factors, utility-level factors, and 
time effects with dummy variables and state-year interaction terms. As a result, I have 
four empirical models: 
Qit = b0 + b1 Pit + b2 Tt + b3 dj + eit   
Qit = b0 + b1 Pit + b2 Tt + b3 dj + b4 dj Tt + eit  
Qit = b0 + b1 Pit + b2 Tt + b3 li + eit  
Qit = b0 + b1 Pit + b2 Tt + b3 li + b4 dj Tt + eit  
In the equations above, Q is installed residential solar capacity (MW) and P is the 
utility’s retail electricity price ($/kWh). Each year, t, is represented by a dummy variable, 
[3] 
[4] 
[5] 
[6] 
 
 
13 
T, in all models [3,4,5,6]. Each state, j, is represented with a dummy variable, d, in the 
OLS models [3,4]. The observation level, i, represents the utility, and each utility is 
represented with a dummy variable, l, in the fixed effects models [5,6]. State-year 
interaction terms, dj Tt, are included in both the OLS [4] and fixed effects [6] models. 
The error terms, eit, measure the residual error and demand not accounted for by the 
variables in the model.  
In the first specification, I have a utility panel with state and year dummies. Year 
dummies control for solar adoption factors that vary over time, but do not vary across 
states or utilities, such as nationwide solar awareness or general declines in solar prices. 
State dummies in the OLS models control for solar adoption factors that vary across 
states, but do not vary within states or across time, such as subsidies, tax credits, net 
metering policy, and insolation. The only instance state dummies are sufficient to control 
for all state-level factors is if these factors do not change over time differently across states. 
For example, if New York enacted a policy to offer solar PV financing during the time 
period of my study – 2010 to 2015, and other states did not, or did so differently, the New 
York dummy could not control for this policy change, and the consequent effect on solar 
adoption (this is the case for a New York 2012 policy). That is why in my next model [4], 
I use state-year interaction terms to control for state factors that differ in each year. These 
state-year interaction terms would be able to control for the 2012 New York policy, for 
example.  
The first two models only capture variation across states, and across time. 
However, some factors that affect solar adoption, like electricity prices or demographics, 
vary within states at a more granular level, and are captured best with a fixed effects 
 
 
14 
specification, or utility dummies, in model [5,6]. The preferred specification [6] 
incorporates both the state-year interaction terms and utility dummies.  
To assess the advantages of utility-level analysis, I compare my results to the 
results of an aggregated state-level analysis. This state analysis follows two models: 
Qit = b0 + b1 Pjt + b2 Tt + ejt   
Qit = b0 + b1 Pjt + b2 Tt + b3 dj + ejt  
 
The observational level, j, represents the state. Electricity price, P, is the state 
average of retail electricity prices across utilities, and installed residential solar capacity, 
Q, is the state’s total installed capacity, or sum of utility-recorded solar capacity.  
IV. Data Description 
 
This section will provide background on my data sources and choice of measures 
for dependent variable, solar adoption, and key independent variable, electricity price.  
For the dependent variable, I follow Sarzynski et al. (2012) and choose cumulative 
installed residential solar capacity installed in megawatts (MW) as the measure of solar 
adoption. Alternatives include number of installations (Kwan 2012, Chan et al. 2016) and 
capacity per capita (DOE 2014). These are all relatively similar measurements, but total 
installed capacity is the only available metric at the utility level. Smart Electric Power 
Association (SEPA), the best-known source for recording utility-level solar capacity, also 
collects data with this metric. 
Electricity price is measured as price per kilowatt hour (kWh) and calculated by 
dividing utility revenues (dollars) by sales (MWh) and converting to dollar per kilowatt 
[7] 
[8] 
 
 
15 
hour units. All authors in the literature follow suit with this electricity price metric, with 
variation in energy unit (Sarzynski et al. 2012, Kwan 2012, Chan et al. 2016). Alberini et 
al. (2011) assert that average prices are not necessarily equal to the prices faced by the 
household; the ideal price measurement would be the price the household actually faces 
which would require household-level data.  
Residential solar data is available from Open PV, which records individual 
installations and the zip code. Although this is the ideal observational level, the 
installations cannot be associated with electricity price data. SEPA3 collects utility-level 
data, but does not a large sample size, and their database is not accessible to the public. 
Thus, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) is the best source of data for this 
project with both residential solar and electricity price data.  
Data for both the dependent and independent variable are provided publicly by 
the Energy Information Administration (EIA)4 through responses to survey form EIA-861 
– Annual Electric Power Industry Report. Law requires electric power industry 
participants, energy service providers, wholesale power marketers, and electric utilities to 
respond to Form EIA-861; 5 this makes this form and its data very reliable. The EIA-861 
                                                             
3 SEPA (Smart Electric Power Association) is recognized as the most reliable source of solar capacity data 
by utility, because they collect solar-specific adoption data from individual utilities; however, the data 
provided in their “Utility Solar Database” is very difficult to use for the purposes of my paper. The main 
problem with these data is a shorter time period, missing observations across time period, and lack of 
residential solar capacity estimates for many utilities, and the sample size of 1098 is comparable to the EIA 
data with more reliable estimates. 
 
4 Kwan (2012) also uses EIA data for electricity price estimates and Alberini et al. (2011) uses EIA-861 form 
data. 
 
5 In 2012, a shorter form, EIA-861S, was set up to reduce respondent burden and speed up EIA processing. 
This form only requires data in the aggregate, not by customer sector, and does not request solar capacity 
data, but asks in if net metering is available. As a result, from 2012 to 2015, data for 1,124 of the total 3,170 
utilities are not available for my analysis. To assess whether the sample is systematically biased without 
 
 
 
16 
form asks for information on sales, electricity purchases, customer counts, demand-side 
management, peak load generation, green pricing, advanced metering, distributed 
generation capacity, and net metering. All data is split by customer sector – residential, 
industrial, commercial, and transportation. For the purposes of this analysis, I focus on 
data from the residential sector; because I want to study the household response to price 
in the adoption of residential solar. I take data from two “schedules” on the EIA-861 form 
– “Net Metering” (Schedule 7-Part A) and “Sales to Ultimate Customers” (Schedule 4).  
The observational level is an electric utility. These can range geographically from 
2 to 20 counties. Some utilities cross state lines, but data on sales and net metering are 
recorded separately for each state within the utility. For this reason, data are at the utility 
level, but split by state.6  
There are several limitations of these data. The EIA admits that the reports on net 
metering are a lower bound of residential installed PV capacity, because not all systems 
are captured on EIA-861 forms. For one, net metering capacity data only includes 
residential solar systems connected to the grid and part of utility net metering programs. 
Although some states mandate net metering and require utilities to connect solar PV 
                                                                                                                                                                                     
these utilities who use the short form, I compare the summary statistics of price from 2007 to 2011, utilities 
that use, and those that do not use the short form. The mean price of those that do not use the short form is 
on average $0.015/kWh lower than those that do. However, those using the short form, have much higher 
standard deviations in price. A member of the EIA-861 survey team said there was no significant trend in 
utilities that do the short form, but noticed that utilities in states with higher fluctuations in electricity price, 
like Alaska and Colorado, tend to use the short form. If this is the case, and utilities not included in my 
sample have on average, higher electricity prices, then this would be a form of selection bias. If these 
utilities have higher electricity prices and lower capacity values on average, this would push my elasticity 
estimates lower. If these utilities have higher electricity prices and higher capacity values, as hypothesized, 
this would push my estimates higher or simply make them more significant.   
6 In my sample, 16 utilities cross state lines, 15 of which cross two states and 1 crosses three. As a result, 
there are 33 observations that have duplicates in utility characteristics, but prices and capacity differ. 
 
 
 
17 
systems to the grid free of charge, other states have restrictions, which may influence the 
capacity of solar PV reported on the form. Second, although the form is mandatory, 
filling in this particular section or schedule to record capacity is voluntary and so many 
utilities do not report. The EIA advises that these unreported values should not be 
interpreted as 0 MW solar PV capacity. This creates an unbalanced panel in my data set, 
where not every utility records capacity for all years in the time period,7 and others start 
recording late in the sample period.8 The EIA goes through a rigorous quality assurance 
process with all data, but some errors slip through. For instance, there are 48 to 86 
instances each year in which capacity falls or drops to zero from one year to the next. 9 
This is highly unlikely unless some or all customers were disconnected from grid, or the 
25-year-old solar panels ran out of life. Ultimately, my data set is the subset of utilities 
that fill out the net metering schedule merged with their matched price data from the 
sales schedule. 
 
 
                                                             
7 In one test, I assumed that all missing values of capacity for utilities that recorded in at least one year were 
equal to zero, thereby creating a balanced panel. The mean price was 0.89 MW lower, as it was pulled 
down by zeros, but there was no significant difference in mean price. Because this assumption is not valid, 
my paper's results use an unbalanced panel.  
8 Because capacity is only an optional segment of the form, there are discrepancies in the capacity data, 
where many utilities start to record net metering solar capacity later in the 2010 to 2015 time period than 
others. The largest difference in mean price change between utilities that started recording later and those 
that recorded throughout the time period was only $0.00027/kWh. I could not identify any significance or 
price change trend for those that started recording capacity later. 
9 There was a slight decline in capacity from year to year for some observations. In these cases, the solar 
panels were no longer connected to the grid or the capacity of solar panels declined over time, given the 
natural rate of depreciation. Price change was compared between those that had a decline in capacity, 283 
observations, with those that either showed no change or increases in capacity, 5,092 observations. The 
median price change was only $0.0008 lower and mean was $0.008 lower for those that had a capacity 
decline. There was no pattern of utilities with capacity decline and declines in price.

V. Summary Statistics  
My sample contains 4,615 observations from 1075 utilities. The state distribution 
of utilities can be found in Table 3. Retail electricity price has a mean of $0.12/kWh, 
ranging from $0.03/kWh to $0.54/kWh between 2010 to 2015 (see Table 1). The mean 
of the sample is consistent with the national average of $0.125/kWh (EIA 2015). As 
shown in Figure 1, electricity price, on average, rises over time. Average electricity price 
varies across utilities from county to county (see Figure 2). For my aggregated state 
analysis, the mean average electricity price for 51 states, including DC, is $0.13/kWh, 
ranging from $0.08/kWh to $0.40/kWh (see Table 2). As shown in Figure 4, average 
electricity price varies across states. 
 
The dependent variable, cumulative installed residential solar PV capacity, has a 
mean of 3.13 MW, ranging from 0 to 1058 MW between 2010 to 2015 (see Table 1). Of 
the 4,615 observations, 2166 had capacity values less than 0.05 MW, 739 less than 0.01 
MW, and 371 less than .005 MW, with 32 values equal to 0. This suggests there is quite a 
spread in capacity, and many utilities have observations of 0 MW capacity either at the 
beginning of the time period or throughout. The high maximum implies there are outliers 
in the sample; however, these high values are consistent with the “population” of 
utilities.10 As shown in Figure 1, average solar capacity increases exponentially over time, 
so the number of installations per year increases over time, as reports suggest (SEIA 
2016). Residential installed solar capacity varies across utilities as seen in Figure 3 
                                                             
10 SEPA’s database suggests a high of 1058.38 MW cumulative residential PV capacity for Pacific Gas & 
Electric in California, 791.2 MW for Southern California Edison, and 507.200 MW for San Diego Gas & 
Electric. The Arizona utility that records the maximum value of capacity sample does not report their data 
to SEPA, but the California competition justifies this large capacity (MW). 
 
 
19 
mapped by county. For my aggregated state level analysis, I measure total installed solar 
capacity as the sum of utility capacity observations for 51 states, including DC. Average 
total installed capacity is 47.55 MW, ranging from 0.004 MW to 2448 MW (see Table 2). 
In Figure 5, we see residential solar capacity varies significantly across U.S. states.  
VI. Analysis and Results   
 
I hypothesize that a rise in retail electricity price will increase installed residential 
solar capacity. This hypothesis will first be tested on a panel of utilities in 8 models with 
increasing complexity: 1) Level-level pooled OLS with state dummies, 2) Level-level 
pooled OLS with state dummies and state-year interaction terms, 3) Log-level11 pooled 
OLS with state dummies, 4) Log-level Pooled OLS with state-year interaction terms, 5) 
Level-level Fixed Effects, 6) Level-level Fixed Effects with state-year interaction terms, 7) 
Log-Level Fixed Effects, 8) Log-level Fixed Effects with state-year interaction terms. The 
four pooled OLS models have state dummies for 51 states, including DC, with Alaska as 
the reference level. All eight models incorporate year dummies for 2010 to 2015, 2010 as 
the reference level, and use the same sample of observations. Coefficient estimates can be 
found in Table 4 and elasticity estimates in Table 5. 
It is important to note when examining these results, 1 MW of solar powers, on 
average, 200 homes; the average home’s residential solar PV system is 5 kW or 0.005 
MW (SEIA 2016). For reference, the average electricity price in my sample, and 
nationwide, is $0.12/kWh and average capacity for my sample of utilities is 3.13 MW, 
but as high as 1057.9 MW.  
                                                             
11 In log-level models, capacity is normalized with a log(x+1) transformation due to many observations of 
zero capacity.  
 
 
20 
The first model, a simple pooled OLS model with state and year dummies 
estimates that every $0.01 increase in electricity price results in 0.33 MW increase in 
capacity, or 66 households. As explained in Section 3, state dummies can only control for 
state-level factors, like state policies, that remain the same over the time period. That is 
why in my next model, and in Model 4, 6, and 8, I use state-year interaction terms to 
control for state factors that may vary over time, such as state policies. Model 2 estimates 
an elasticity of 1.451, up from 1.289 in Model 1. Model 1 and 2 are the only models with 
elasticity estimates not significant at the 0.01 level, but are significant at the 0.2 level. 
In the next model, and in the fixed effects models, a log-level specification log 
normalizes capacity to better fit the capacity data.12 Model 3, a log-level model with the 
same specification as Model 1, estimates a coefficient of 1.75. A $0.01 increase in price 
increases capacity by 1.75%. The elasticity is 0.585, much lower than Model 1 and 2. In 
Figure 6 and 7, there is a pronounced pattern in the residuals, but the log-level Model 3 
condenses the spread in residuals, as logging capacity is a better fit for the data. Model 4 
is the same as Model 3 but incorporates state-year interaction terms. The model estimates 
a $0.01 increase in electricity price increases capacity by 2.01%, compared to 1.8%. In 
both the log-level and level-level OLS models, the elasticity and coefficient estimates 
increase with the incorporation of state-year interaction terms. Thus, the greater controls 
increase the impact of electricity price on solar adoption due to omitted variable bias 
without state-year interaction terms. 
                                                             
12 The spread of electricity price does not justify a log transformation. A log-log specification estimated an 
elasticity of 2.56 for OLS with state-year interaction terms and an elasticity of 2.02 for fixed effects with 
state-year interaction terms. Both elasticities are higher than the log-level specification results; however, the 
residual plot looked similar to the latter model (see Figure 7).    
 
 
21 
Next, I will analyze the fixed effects models, which control for utility-level effects, 
or differences across utilities. In Model 5, I estimate a price coefficient of 147, so that a 
$0.01 increase in price will increase capacity by about 1.47 MW, or 294 homes. In Model 
6, with state-year interaction terms, a $0.01 increase in price increases capacity by 2.37 
MW, or 474 home installations. This coefficient is 7 times the magnitude of the Model 1 
coefficient. 
 In the log-level Model 7, the elasticity estimate is 1.05, but the addition of state-
year interaction terms in Model 8 increases the estimate to 1.85. The coefficient estimate 
of Model 8 is interpreted as a $0.01 increase in electricity price increases capacity by 
5.54%. This final model is the preferred specification as it is the most complex, 
controlling for utility, state-year, and year effects, and best fit with logged capacity. 
However, this model’s residual plot (see Figure 8) and other log-level model residual plots 
show a pattern of values following a 1:1 downward slope. These fitted values line up with 
capacity observations very close to 0 MW.13 Also, the residual plot shows some states with 
high positive residuals, including Hawaii, where one utility increases in capacity from 3 
MW to 47 MW in the time period.14 Due to this clear trend in my residual plot, I will 
explore problems and possible solutions in my discussion.  
                                                             
13 When the capacity values less than .005 MW are dropped from Model 5, level-level fixed effects, the 
residual plot looks the same and the price coefficient is 5.873 compared to slightly lower, 5.539, with zeros. 
This leads me to believe the zero values are not necessarily the problem.  
14 These residuals prompted me to test if modeling change in price to change in capacity, would better fit 
the price-capacity relationship. With a log-level fixed effects with state-year interactions specification, I find 
a 1% increase in year to year price change increases the growth in capacity by 0.03%. The residual plot of 
this model shows even stronger patterns in residuals, suggesting this specification does not solve the problem 
of residual patterns. 
 
 
 
22 
Next, I perform a state-level analysis to compare my prior results and establish 
benefits and costs of utility-level analysis. The same hypothesis will be tested with a 51-
state panel in 4 models, matching the utility-level analysis specifications: 1) Level-level 
pooled OLS with year dummies, 2) Log-level pooled OLS with year dummies, 3) Level-
level fixed effects with year dummies, and 4) Log-level fixed effects with year dummies. In 
order to compare the results of these models to my utility-level results, I will compare 
elasticity estimates in Table 7, but coefficient estimates can be found in Table 6. The log-
level OLS model results in an elasticity estimate of 1.04, compared to 0.59 to 0.67 
elasticity in Model 3 and 4 of my utility-level analysis. The state log-level fixed effects 
model results in an elasticity of 1.281, compared to the utility-level model of 1.05 to 1.85 
in Model 7 and 8. So, state level elasticity estimates range both higher and lower than my 
utility level estimates. The residual plot of Figure 9, shows a more uniform spread in 
residuals, compared to the pattern of residuals in Figure 8. This is most likely due to 
larger capacity values, and fewer capacity values close to 0 MW. It is unclear if there is 
significant bias from analyzing this relationship at the state-level; the estimation errors in 
my utility level analysis are also present in my state-level analysis. 
VII. Discussion  
 
In summary, in the preferred specification, log-level fixed effects with state-year 
interaction terms, I find a price elasticity of 1.85, compared to literature estimates of 1.4 
to 1.97 (Chan et al. 2016) and 2.03 to 2.27 (Sarzynski et al. 2012). These results and 
policy implications must be interpreted with caution. There are certain limitations of my 
analysis, including omitted variable bias and endogeneity, as evidenced by the 
pronounced pattern in my residual plot (see Figure 8) and high elasticity estimates. 
 
 
23 
This paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, panel data analysis 
takes into account changes over time and allows use of fixed effects to capture sources of 
variation that are correlated with electricity price. Second, studying this relationship at 
the utility level captures heterogeneity in electricity prices within states and more closely 
matches the prices households face, compared to state-level analysis (Sarzynski et al. 
2012, Durham et al. 1988). Although this is not as granular as household-level or zip-code 
level data (Kwan 2012), I am able to assess the benefits and costs of this aggregated 
approach.  
The greatest disadvantage of observing data at the utility level to study this 
relationship is that data for control variables is unavailable at the utility level. My use of 
state dummies, state-year interaction terms, and utility dummies, is useful, but some 
factors vary at a more granular level. If these factors, not controlled for in my models, are 
correlated with electricity prices, I have omitted variable bias.  
In particular, a very important determinant in solar demand is solar prices. 
Although electricity price, the price of a substitute, may explain solar demand, as theory 
suggests, solar demand is more significantly caused by price of solar. Although it would 
seem customers would be guaranteed the same price, according to Gillingham et al. 
(2016) solar prices differ within U.S. states based on system characteristics, market 
structure, and greater demand. So, solar prices may differ across households within 
utilities, and are not controlled for in my models with utility dummies.  
Over the last decade, solar prices have been falling exponentially as electricity 
prices have been rising incrementally; this makes solar prices and electricity prices 
negatively correlated. In this case, I have endogeneity bias due to simultaneous causality 
 
 
24 
and omitted variables. In a granger causality test, price granger causes capacity with 
significance at the 0.002 level, but solar capacity granger causes price at an even higher 
significance of less than 0.0001. This proves my cross-price elasticity estimates are higher 
than the actual value, and including solar prices in my models would reduce my 
estimates. Although these estimates accord with literature estimates, these papers also fail 
to control for solar prices. The solution would be to use instrumental variables or to do a 
simultaneous regression in which solar prices determine solar capacity and then capacity 
explains the capacity, controlling for solar price.  
 
I performed a robustness test to check if the variation in levelized cost of electricity 
(LCOE) accounts for the variation in residuals across utilities within a state. In other 
words, does the absence of LCOE in my models explain the residual error. Besides 
electricity price, LCOE is determined by solar potential and the amount of sunlight, 
quantified as insolation. In states with high variation in insolation, like Washington which 
varies east to west, and California which varies north to south, I would expect greater 
standard deviation in residuals. In my sample, Washington, with 37 utilities, has a 
standard deviation of 0.67, and California (31 utilities) has a deviation of 1.4, compared 
to a higher value of 1.8 in Arizona (15 utilities) where LCOE is relatively homogenous.  
 
The peer effect,15 where neighbors influence your willingness to adopt solar, is 
also not controlled in the current model. Over time, households are exposed to solar 
                                                             
15 Others study spatial patterns of solar adoption and find a strong relationship between adoption and 
previous installations, providing evidence of peer effects in the adoption of residential solar (Graziano & 
Gillingham 2015). One paper estimates an additional installation increases the probability of adoption in 
 
 
 
25 
panels as their “neighbors” adopt, and they are in turn made aware of the benefits of 
solar energy. This is evident in the exponential growth in solar capacity over time. The 
year dummies control for general trends that occur over time, but do not vary within 
states or across states. The network effect would not differ across states, but could 
between rural and urban regions within a state. If, for example, the network effect were 
greater in urban locations where people are closer to their neighbors and have more 
neighbors, this would not bias my estimates as the variation is not influenced by electricity 
price.  
 Another area of bias is the use of average electricity prices for each utility, 
although households in a single utility may face different retail rates because of different 
pricing structures. Many authors have studied the impact of retail rate design or 
electricity pricing structure on the cost-competitiveness and adoption of solar.16 However, 
the authors fail to consider how the household perceives the solar investment. With 
asymmetric information, the household may believe and incorrectly calculate the bill 
savings and net metering benefits that time-of-use, flat-rate tariff, or peak demand rates 
provide. I believe, according to my theory, the total cost on each electricity bill is more 
                                                                                                                                                                                     
the same zip code by 0.78%, and peer effects lead to greater capacity installed (Bollinger & Gillingham 
2012).  
16 Procter & Tyner's (1984) simulation model find that solar PV systems with the federal solar tax credit, 
were not cost-competitive with peak load pricing, where consumers are charged different rates based on the 
time of day, but were competitive with block pricing. Their findings tell us that pricing structure impacts the 
cost-competitiveness of solar in the presence of subsidies. However, with the simulation model, they are not 
able to assess the consumer’s response to price changes, or whether the consumer would correctly estimate 
and consider the cost-competitiveness and retail rate structure in their decision to invest. Borenstein (2007) 
similarly assesses the incentives for PV under different pricing structures, by comparing net metering under 
time of use (TOU) rates, which charge higher prices at peak demand times, and flat-rate tariffs, which 
charge a constant price, analyzing data from 2 utilities. With a statistical comparison of electricity bills, the 
author finds that TOU rates do not make PV less attractive than the flat rate tariff, and even in some cases 
TOU rates were better than flat-rate. Darghouth et al. (2011) analyzes the same two utilities to assess 
variations in bill savings according to retail rate design. 
 
 
26 
influential, not how this cost is determined; so, households charged with different 
electricity rate designs would not differ in their response. However, the use of average 
prices is still a concern for my model.  
Another variable, central to the theoretical equations, is the discount rate, which is 
influenced by demographic variables, such as education and wealth. Higher education 
levels may enhance the household’s ability to evaluate the investment on a benefit-cost 
basis. Wealthier households tend to consume more, and are more negatively impacted by 
rises in electricity price, yet these same households may not look at their electricity bills or 
react as strongly to changes in electricity price as lower-income households. Both of these 
factors are best measured at the household level. Neither education nor wealth are 
correlated with electricity price, as retail electricity prices neither vary household to 
household within the same utility nor change due to income or education. Yet, both 
factors may influence how electricity prices affect a household’s response to changes in 
electricity price and consequent adoption of solar.  
Many of these problems are due to my choice of observing data at the utility level. 
Estimates for demographic variables, solar prices, or policy specifics are not available at 
this observational level. For this reason, I provide a word of caution for researchers: 
Although utility level analysis accounts for the variation in electricity price across states, 
compared to state-level analysis, survey data would be more appropriate. This survey 
would measure actual electricity prices faced by the household, the degree to which 
households considered net metering and bill savings benefits prior to their investment 
decision, and all other factors of the household’s investment decision that are the core of 
 
 
27 
my theoretical model. The closest available source to this ideal data is Open PV project, 
which does not yet include electricity prices faced by the household prior to installation. 
Future researchers should expand my study with a more extensive sample across 
more years, and by controlling for all factors correlated with electricity price, like solar 
prices, that affect a household’s willingness to invest in residential solar. It would be 
important to evaluate how the type of pricing plan, block pricing, fixed tariff, informs 
solar investment, and how absence of net metering programs, a component of my 
theoretical model, would alter these results. Additionally, authors should explore the 
effect of lagging electricity price on regression model results. Does a household evaluate 
electricity prices over a longer period of time up to their investment? If so, by lagging 
electricity price and extending electricity data back before 2010, it may improve the fit of 
these models. I would be interested to see how long it takes for households to respond to 
electricity price increases in the presence of a carbon tax. The best method to perform 
this research is with household-level data that accounts for demographics and a 
household’s true electricity price.   
VIII. Conclusion  
My findings suggest that electricity price is significantly positively correlated with 
solar adoption. In the preferred specification, log-level fixed effects with state-year 
interaction terms, I find a price elasticity estimate of 1.85, in the range of literature 
estimates (Chan et al. 2016, Sarzynski et al. 2012). My results suggest that if a carbon tax 
were to increase electricity prices by 8.5%, as suggested by Rivers (2012), capacity would 
increase by 15.73%. These results are limited by endogeneity bias. My study is the first to 
focus on the influence of electricity price on the residential adoption of solar PV with data 
 
 
28 
at the utility level. Currently, the U.S. has the fastest developing market 
of residential solar in the world, so understanding causes of this growth will help other 
countries choose the most effect policy measure to incentivize solar. With the possibility of 
carbon taxes on grid electricity, researchers and policymakers must understand how will 
households respond, and at what rate will they choose to invest in solar?

Recently
 it  has  become
 clear  that many  technologies
 follow  a generalized
 version
 of  Moore’s
 law,
 i.e. costs
tend
 to drop  exponentially,
 at different
 rates  that depend
 on  the  technology.
 Here  we  formulate
 Moore’s
law
 as a correlated
 geometric
 random  walk with drift,  and apply  it  to historical
 data
 on  53  technologies.
We
 derive
 a closed
 form  expression
 approximating
 the  distribution
 of forecast
 errors
 as  a  function
 of
time.
 Based  on  hind-casting
 experiments
 we  show  that  this  works  well,  making
 it possible
 to  collapse
the
 forecast
 errors
 for  many  different  technologies
 at different
 time
 horizons
 onto  the  same  universal
distribution.
 This  is valuable
 because
 it  allows  us to  make
 forecasts
 for  any  given technology
 with  a
clear
 understanding
 of  the  quality
 of  the forecasts.
 As  a practical
 demonstration
 we  make
 distributional
forecasts
 at  different
 time  horizons
 for solar  photovoltaic
 modules,
 and  show
 how  our  method
 can
 be
used
 to estimate
 the
 probability
 that a  given
 technology
 will  outperform
 another  technology
 at
 a given
point
 in the future.

 Introduction
Technological
 progress
 is
 widely
 acknowledged
 as
 the
 main
driver
 of
 economic
 growth,
 and
 thus
 any
 method
 for
 improved
technological
 forecasting
 is
 potentially
 very
 useful.
 Given
 that
technological
 progress
 depends
 on
 innovation,
 which
 is
 gener-
ally
 thought
 of
 as
 something
 new
 and
 unanticipated,
 forecasting
it
 might
 seem
 to
 be
 an
 oxymoron.
 In
 fact
 there
 are
 several
 pos-
tulated
 laws
 for
 technological
 improvement,
 such
 as
 Moore’s
 law
and
 Wright’s
 law,
 that
 have
 been
 used
 to
 make
 predictions
 about
technology
 cost
 and
 performance.
 But
 how
 well
 do
 these
 methods
work?
Predictions
 are
 useful
 because
 they
 allow
 us
 to
 plan,
 but
 to
 form
good
 plans
 it
 is
 necessary
 to
 know
 probabilities
 of
 possible
 out-
comes.
 Point
 forecasts
 are
 of
 limited
 value
 unless
 they
 are
 very
accurate,
 and
 when
 uncertainties
 are
 large
 they
 can
 even
 be
 dan-
gerous
 if
 they
 are
 taken
 too
 seriously.
 At
 the
 very
 least

 or
 better
 yet,
 a
 distributional
 forecast,
 estimating
 the
likelihood
 of
 different
 future
 outcomes.
 Although
 there
 are
 now
a
 few
 papers
 testing
 technological
 forecasts1 there
 is
 as
 yet
 no
method
 that
 gives
 distributional
 forecasts
 based
 on
 an
 empirically
validated
 stochastic
 process.
 In
 this
 paper
 we
 remedy
 this
 situa-
tion
 by
 deriving
 the
 distributional
 errors
 for
 a
 simple
 forecasting
method
 and
 testing
 our
 predictions
 on
 empirical
 data
 on
 tech-
nology
 costs.
 To
 motivate
 the
 problem
 that
 we
 address,
 consider
three
 technologies
 related
 to
 electricity
 generation:
 coal
 mining,
nuclear
 power
 and
 photovoltaic
 modules.

 Over
 the
 last
 150
 years
 the
 inﬂation-
adjusted
 price
 of
 coal
 has
 ﬂuctuated
 by
 a
 factor
 of
 three
 or
 so,
but
 shows
 no
 long
 term
 trend,
 and
 indeed
 from
 the
 historical
 time
series
 one
 cannot
 reject
 the
 null
 hypothesis
 of

 of

 for
 any
 particular
 method.
 McCrory,
cited
 in
 Jantsch
 (1967), assumes
 a
 Gaussian
 distribution
 and
 uses
 this
 to
 calculate
the
 probability
 that
 a
 targeted
 level
 of
 progress
 be
 met
 at
 a
 given
 horizon.
 Here
 we
assume
 and
 test
 a
 Gaussian
 distribution
 for
 the
 natural
 log.

 Nuclear
 power
 and
 solar
 pho-
tovoltaic
 electricity,
 in
 contrast,
 are
 both
 new
 technologies
 that
emerged
 at
 roughly
 the
 same
 time.
 The
 ﬁrst
 commercial
 nuclear
power
 plant
 opened
 in
 1956
 and
 the
 ﬁrst
 practical
 use
 of
 solar
 pho-
tovoltaics
 was
 as
 a
 power
 supply
 for
 the
 Vanguard
 I
 satellite
 in
 1958.
The
 cost
 of
 electricity
 generated
 by
 nuclear
 power
 is
 highly
 variable,
but
 has
 generally
 increased
 by
 a
 factor
 of
 two
 or
 three
 during
 the
period
 shown
 here.
 In
 contrast,
 a
 watt
 of
 solar
 photovoltaic
 capac-
ity
 cost
 $256
 in
 1956
 (Perlin,
 1999)
 (about
 $1910
 in
 2013
 dollars)
vs.
 $0.82
 in
 2013,
 dropping
 in
 price
 by
 a
 factor
 of
 about
 2330.
 Since
1980
 photovoltaic
 modules
 have
 decreased
 in
 cost
 at
 an
 average
rate
 of
 about
 10%
 per
 year.
In
 giving
 this
 example
 we
 are
 not
 trying
 to
 make
 a
 head-to-
head
 comparison
 of
 the
 full
 system
 costs
 for
 generating
 electricity.
Instead
 we
 are
 comparing
 three
 different
 technologies,
 coal
 mining,
nuclear
 power
 and
 photovoltaic
 manufacture.
 Generating
 electric-
ity
 with
 coal
 requires
 plant
 construction
 (whose
 historical
 cost
has
 dropped
 considerably
 since
 the
 ﬁrst
 plants
 came
 online
 at
 the
beginning
 of
 the
 20th
 century).
 Generating
 electricity
 via
 solar
 pho-
tovoltaics
 has

 costs
 that
 have
 not
 dropped
 as
 fast
as
 that
 of

 Our
 point
 here
 is
 that
 different
technologies
 can
 decrease
 in
 cost
 at
 very
 different
 rates.
Predicting
 the
 rate
 of
 technological
 improvement
 is
 obviously
very
 useful
 for
 planning
 and
 investment.
 But

such
 trends?
 In
 response
 to
 a
 forecast
 that
 the
 trends
 above
 will
continue,
 a
 skeptic
 would
 rightfully
 respond,
 “How
 do
 we
 know
that
 the
 historical
 trend
 will
 continue?
 Isn’t
 it
 possible
 that
 things
will
 reverse,
 and
 over
 the
 next
 20
 years
 coal
 will
 drop
 in
 price
dramatically
 and
 solar
 will
 go
 back
 up?”.
Our
 paper
 provides
 a
 quantitative
 answer
 to
 this
 question.
 We
put
 ourselves
 in
 the
 past,
 pretend
 we
 don’t
 know
 the
 future,
 and
use
 a
 simple
 method
 to
 forecast
 the
 costs
 of
 53
 different
 technolo-
gies.
 Actually
 going
 through
 the
 exercise
 of
 making
 out-of-sample
forecasts
 rather
 than
 simply
 doing
 in-sample
 regressions
 has
 the
essential
 advantage
 that
 it
 fully
 mimics
 the
 process
 of
 making
 fore-
casts
 and
 allows
 us
 to
 say
 precisely
 how
 well
 forecasts
 would
 have
performed.
 Out-of-sample
 testing
 such
 as
 we
 do
 here
 is
 particularly
important
 when
 models
 are
 mis-speciﬁed,
 which
 one
 expects
 for
 a
complicated
 phenomenon
 such
 as
 technological
 improvement.
We  show
 how
 one
 can
 combine
 the
 experience
 from
 forecast-
ing
 many
 technologies
 to
 make
 reliable
 distributional
 forecasts
 for
a
 given
 technology.
 For
 solar
 PV
 modules,
 for
 example,
 we
 can
 say,
“Based
 on
 experience
 with
 many
 other
 technologies,
 the
 probabil-
ity
 is
 roughly
 5%
 that
 in
 2030
 the
 price
 of
 solar
 PV
 modules
 will
 be
greater
 than
 or
 equal
 to
 their
 current
 (2013)
 price”.
 We  can
 assign
 a
probability
 to
 different
 price
 levels
 at
 different
 points
 in
 the
 future,
as
 is
 done
 later
 in
 Fig.
 10
 (where
 we  show
 that
 very
 likely
 the
 price
will
 drop
 signiﬁcantly).
 We  can
 also
 compare
 different
 technolo-
gies
 to
 assess
 the
 likelihood
 of
 different
 future
 scenarios
 for
 their
relative
 prices,
 as
 is
 done
 in
 Fig.
 11.
Technological
 costs
 occasionally
 experience
 structural
 breaks
where
 trends
 change.
 Indeed
 there
 are
 several
 clear
 examples
 in
 our
historical
 data,
 and
 although
 we
 have
 not
 explicitly
 modeled
 this,
their
 effect
 on
 forecast
 errors
 is
 included
 in
 the
 empirical
 analysis
we
 have
 done
 here.
 The
 point
 is
 that,
 while
 such
 structural
 breaks
happen,
 they
 are
 not
 so
 large
 and
 so
 common
 as
 to
 over-ride
 our
ability
 to
 forecast.
 Every
 technology
 has
 its
 own
 story,
 its
 own
 spe-
ciﬁc
 set
 of
 causes
 and
 effects,
 that
 explain
 why
 costs
 went
 up
 or
down
 in
 any
 given
 year.
 Nonetheless,
 as
 we
 demonstrate
 here,
 the
long
 term
 trends
 tend
 to
 be
 consistent,
 and
 can
 be
 captured
 via
 his-
torical
 time
 series
 methods
 with
 no
 direct
 information
 about
 the
underlying
 technology-speciﬁc
 stories.
In
 this
 paper
 we
 use
 a
 very
 simple
 approach
 to
 forecasting
that
 was
 originally
 motivated
 by
 Moore’s
 Law.
 As
 everyone
 knows,
Intel’s
 ex-CEO,
 Gordon
 Moore,
 famously
 predicted
 that
 the
 number
of
 transistors
 on
 integrated
 circuits
 would
 double
 every
 two
 years,
i.e.
 at
 an
 annual
 rate
 of
 about
 40%.
 Making
 transistors
 smaller
 also
brings
 along
 a
 variety
 of
 other
 beneﬁts,
 such
 as
 increased
 speed,
decreased
 power
 consumption,
 and
 less
 expensive
 manufacture
costs
 per
 unit
 of
 computation.
 As
 a
 result
 it
 quickly
 became
 clear
that
 Moore’s
 law
 applies
 more
 broadly,
 for
 example,
 implying
 a
doubling
 of
 computational
 speed
 every
 18
 months.
Moore’s
 law
 stimulated
 others
 to
 look
 at
 related
 data
 more
carefully,
 and
 they
 discovered
 that
 exponential
 improvement
 is
 a
reasonable
 approximation
 for
 other
 types
 of
 computer
 hardware
as
 well,
 such
 as
 hard
 drives.
 Since
 the
 performance
 of
 hard
 drives
depends
 on
 physical
 factors
 that
 are
 unrelated
 to
 transistor
 density
this
 is
 an
 independent
 fact,
 though
 of
 course
 the
 fact
 that
 mass
 stor-
age
 is
 essential
 for
 computation
 causes
 a
 tight
 coupling
 between
 the
two
 technologies.
 Lienhard,
 Koh
 and
 Magee,
 and
 others3 examined
data
 for
 other
 products,
 including
 many
 that
 have
 nothing
 to
 do
3 Examples
 include
 Lienhard
 (2006), Koh
 and
 Magee
 (2006,
 2008), Bailey
 et
 al.
(2012), Benson
 and
 Magee
 (2014a,b), Nagy
 et
 al.
 (2013). Studies
 of
 improvement
in
 computers
 over
 long
 spans
 of
 time
 indicate
 super-exponential
 improvement
(Nordhaus,
 2007;
 Nagy
 et
 al.,
 2011),
 suggesting
 that
 Moore’s
 law
 may
 only
 be
 an
approximation
 reasonably
 valid
 over
 spans
 of
 time
 of
 50
 years
 or
 less.

 scaling,

with
 computation
 or
 information
 processing,
 and
 postulated
 that
exponential
 improvement
 is
 a
 much
 more
 general
 phenomenon
that
 applies
 to
 many
 different
 technologies,
 even
 if
 in
 most
 cases
the
 exponential
 rates
 are
 much
 slower.
Although
 Moore’s
 law
 is
 traditionally
 applied
 as
 a
 regression
 of
the
 log
 of
 the
 cost
 on
 a
 deterministic
 time
 trend,
 we  reformulate
 it
here
 as
 a
 geometric
 random
 walk
 with
 drift.
 This
 has
 several
 advan-
tages.
 On
 average
 it
 results
 in
 more
 accurate
 forecasts,
 especially
 at
short
 horizons,
 indicating
 that
 it
 is
 indeed
 a
 better
 model.
 In
 addi-
tion,
 this
 allows
 us
 to
 use
 standard
 results
 from
 the
 time
 series
forecasting
 literature4. The
 technology
 time
 series
 in
 our
 sample
are
 typically
 rather
 short,
 often
 only
 15
 or
 20
 points
 long,
 so
 to
 test
hypotheses
 it
 is
 essential
 to
 pool
 the
 data.
 Because
 the
 geometric
random
 walk
 is
 so
 simple
 it
 is
 possible
 to
 derive
 formulas
 for
 the
forecast
 errors
 in
 closed
 form.
 This
 makes
 it
 possible
 to
 estimate
the
 forecast
 errors
 as
 a
 function
 of
 both
 sample
 size
 and
 forecast-
ing
 horizon,
 and
 to
 combine
 data
 from
 many
 different
 technologies
into
 a
 single
 analysis.
 This
 allows
 us
 to
 get
 highly
 statistically
 sig-
niﬁcant
 results.
 And
 most
 importantly,
 because
 this
 allows
 us
 to
systematically
 test
 the
 method
 on
 data
 for
 many
 different
 tech-
nologies,
 this
 allows
 us
 to
 make
 distributional
 forecasts
 for
 a
 single
technology
 and
 have
 conﬁdence
 in
 the
 results.
Motivated
 by
 structure
 we
 ﬁnd
 in
 the
 data,
 we  further
 extend
Moore’s
 law
 to
 allow
 for
 the
 possibility
 that
 changes
 in
 price
 are
positively
 autocorrelated
 in
 time.
 We  assume
 that
 the
 logarithm
of
 the
 cost
 follows
 a
 random
 walk
 with
 drift
 and
 autocorrelated
noise,
 more
 speciﬁcally
 an
 Integrated
 Moving
 Average
 process
 of
order
 (1,1),
 i.e.
 an
 IMA(1,1)
 model.
 Under
 the
 assumption
 of
 suf-
ﬁciently
 large
 autocorrelation
 this
 method
 produces
 a
 good
 ﬁt
to
 the
 empirically
 observed
 forecasting
 errors.
 We  derive
 a
 for-
mula
 for
 the
 errors
 of
 this
 more
 general
 model,
 assuming
 that
all
 technologies
 have
 the
 same
 autocorrelation
 parameter
 and
 the
forecasts
 are
 made
 using
 the
 simple
 random
 walk
 model.
 We use
this
 to
 forecast
 the
 likely
 distribution
 of
 the
 price
 of
 photovoltaic
solar
 modules,
 and
 to
 estimate
 the
 probability
 that
 solar
 mod-
ules
 will
 undercut
 a
 competing
 technology
 at
 a
 given
 date
 in
 the
future.
We want
 to
 stress
 that
 we
 do
 not
 mean
 to
 claim
 that
 the
 gener-
alizations
 of
 Moore’s
 law
 explored
 here
 provide
 the
 most
 accurate
possible
 forecasts
 for
 technological
 progress.
 There
 is
 a
 large
 litera-
ture
 on
 experience
 curves5, studying
 the
 relationship
 between
 cost
and
 cumulative
 production
 originally
 suggested
 by
 Wright
 (1936),
and
 many
 authors
 have
 proposed
 alternatives
 and
 generalizations6.
Nagy
 et
 al.
 (2013)
 tested
 these
 alternatives
 using
 a
 data
 set
 that
is
 very
 close
 to
 ours
 and
 found
 that
 Moore’s
 and
 Wright’s
 laws
were
 roughly
 tied
 for
 ﬁrst
 place
 in
 terms
 of
 their
 forecasting
 per-
formance.
 An
 important
 caveat
 is
 that
 Nagy
 et
 al.’s
 study
 was
 based
on
 a
 trend
 stationary
 model,
 and
 as
 we
 argue
 here,
 the
 difference
stationary
 model
 is
 superior,
 both
 for
 forecasting
 and
 for
 statistical
testing.
 It
 seems
 likely
 that
 methods
 using
 auxiliary
 data
 such
 as
production,
 patent
 activity,
 or
 R&D
 can
 be
 used
 to
 make
 forecasts
for
 technological
 progress
 that
 incorporate
 more
 factors,
 and
 that
4 Several
 methods
 have
 been
 deﬁned
 to
 obtain
 prediction
 intervals,
 i.e.
 error
 bars
for
 the
 forecasts
 (Chatﬁeld,
 1993). The
 classical
 Box-Jenkins
 methodology
 for
 ARIMA
processes
 uses
 a
 theoretical
 formula
 for
 the
 variance
 of
 the
 process,
 but
 does
 not
account
 for
 uncertainty
 due
 to
 parameter
 estimates.
 Another
 approach
 is
 to
 use
the
 empirical
 forecast
 errors
 to
 estimate
 the
 distribution
 of
 forecast
 errors.
 In
 this
case,
 one
 can
 use
 either
 the
 in-sample
 errors
 (the
 residuals,
 as
 in
 e.g.
 Taylor
 and
Bunn
 (1999)),
 or
 the
 out-of-sample
 forecast
 errors
 (Williams
 and
 Goodman,
 1971;
Lee
 and
 Scholtes,
 2014).
 Several
 studies
 have
 found
 that
 using
 residuals
 leads
 to
prediction
 intervals
 which
 are
 too
 tight
 (Makridakis
 and
 Winkler,
 1989).

 (2007), Nordhaus
 (2014).
such
 methods
 should
 yield
 improvements
 over
 the
 simple
 method
we
 use
 here7.
The
 key
 assumption
 made
 here
 is
 that
 all
 technologies
 follow
the
 same
 random
 process,
 even
 if
 the
 drift
 and
 volatility
 parame-
ters
 of
 the
 random
 process
 are
 technology
 speciﬁc.
 This
 allows
 us
to
 develop
 distributional
 forecasts
 in
 a
 highly
 parsimonious
 man-
ner
 and
 efﬁciently
 test
 them
 out
 of
 sample.
 We  restrict
 ourselves
to
 forecasting
 unit
 cost
 in
 this
 paper,
 for
 the
 simple
 reason
 that
we
 have
 data
 for
 it
 and
 it
 is
 comparable
 across
 different
 technolo-
gies.
 The
 work
 presented
 here
 provides
 a
 simple
 benchmark
 against
which
 to
 compare
 forecasts
 of
 future
 technological
 performance
based
 on
 other
 methods.
The
 approach
 of
 basing
 technological
 forecasts
 on
 historical
 data
that
 we  pursue
 here
 stands
 in
 sharp
 contrast
 to
 the
 most
 widely
used
 method,
 which
 is
 based
 on
 expert
 opinions.
 The
 use
 of
 expert
opinions
 is
 clearly
 valuable,
 and
 we
 do
 not
 suggest
 that
 it
 should
 be
supplanted,
 but
 it
 has
 several
 serious
 drawbacks.
 Expert
 opinions
are
 subjective
 and
 can
 be
 biased
 for
 a
 variety
 of
 reasons
 (Albright,
2002),
 including
 common
 information,
 herding,
 or
 vested
 interest.
Forecasts
 for
 the
 costs
 of
 nuclear
 power
 in
 the
 US,
 for
 example,
were
 for
 several
 decades
 consistently
 low
 by
 roughly
 a
 factor
 of
three
 (Cooper,
 2009).
 A
 second
 problem
 is
 that
 it
 is
 very
 hard
 to
assess
 the
 accuracy
 of
 expert
 forecasts.
 In
 contrast
 the
 method
 we
develop
 here
 is
 objective
 and
 the
 quality
 of
 the
 forecasts
 is
 known.
Nonetheless
 we  believe
 that
 both
 methods
 are
 valuable
 and
 that
they
 should
 be
 used
 side-by-side.8
The
 remainder
 of
 the
 paper
 develops
 as
 follows:
 in
 Section
 2
 we
derive
 the
 error
 distribution
 for
 forecasts
 based
 on
 the
 geometric
random
 walk
 as
 a
 function
 of
 time
 horizon
 and
 other
 parameters
and
 show
 how
 the
 data
 for
 different
 technologies
 and
 time
 horizons
should
 be
 collapsed.
 We  also
 show
 how
 this
 can
 be
 generalized
 to
allow
 for
 autocorrelations
 in
 the
 data
 and
 derive
 similar
 (approxi-
mate)
 formulas.
 In
 Section
 3
 we
 describe
 our
 data
 set
 and
 present
an
 empirical
 relationship
 between
 the
 variance
 of
 the
 noise
 and
the
 improvement
 rate
 for
 different
 technologies.
 In
 Section
 4
 we
describe
 our
 method
 of
 testing
 the
 models
 against
 the
 data,
 and
present
 the
 results
 in
 Section
 5. We  then
 apply
 our
 method
 to
give
 a
 distributional
 forecast
 for
 solar
 module
 prices
 in
 Section
 6
and
 show
 how
 this
 can
 be
 used
 to
 forecast
 the
 likelihood
 that
 one
technology
 will
 overtake
 another.
 Finally
 we  give
 some
 concluding
remarks
 in
 Section
 7. A
 variety
 of
 technical
 results
 are
 given
 in
 the
appendices.

 Models
2.1.
 Geometric
 random
 walk
In
 this
 section
 we
 discuss
 how
 to
 formulate
 Moore’s
 law
 in
 the
presence
 of
 noise
 and
 argue
 that
 the
 best
 method
 is
 the
 geometric
random
 walk
 with
 drift.
 We  then
 present
 a
 formula
 for
 the
 distri-
bution
 of
 expected
 errors
 as
 a
 function
 of
 the
 time
 horizon
 and
the
 other
 parameters
 of
 the
 model,
 and
 generalize
 the
 formula
to
 allow
 for
 autocorrelation
 in
 the
 data
 generating
 process.
 This
allows
 us
 to
 pool
 the
 errors
 for
 many
 different
 technologies.
 This
is
 extremely
 useful
 because
 it
 makes
 it
 possible
 to
 test
 the
 validity
of
 these
 results
 using
 many
 short
 time
 series
 (such
 as
 the
 data
 we
have
 here).

 (If
 the

 is

 then
 
 <
 0.)
 In
 order
 to
 ﬁt
 this
 to
 data
 one
 has
 to
 allow
 for
the
 possibility
 of
 errors
 and
 make
 an
 assumption
 about
 the
 struc-
ture
 of
 the
 errors.
 Typically
 the
 literature
 has
 treated
 Moore’s
 law
using
 a
 trend
 stationary
 model,
 minimizing
 squared
 errors
 to
 ﬁt
 a
model
 of
 the
 form
yt =
 y0 +
 t
 +
 et,
 
(1)
where
 yt =
 log(pt).
 From
 the
 point
 of
 view
 of
 the
 regression,
 y0 is
the
 intercept,
 
 is
 the
 slope
 and
 et is
 independent
 and
 identically
distributed
 (i.i.d.)
 noise.
But
 records
 of
 technological
 performance
 such
 as
 those
 we
 study
here
 are
 time
 series,
 giving
 the
 costs
 pjt for
 technology
 j at
 succes-
sive
 times
 t
 =
 1,
 2,
 .
 .
 .,  Tj. It
 is
 therefore
 more
 natural
 to
 use
 a
 time
series
 model.
 The
 simplest
 possible
 choice
 that
 yields
 Moore’s
 law
in
 the
 deterministic
 limit
 is
 the
 geometric
 random
 walk
 with
 drift,
yt =
 yt−1 +
 
 +
 nt.
(2)
As
 before
 
 is
 the
 drift
 and
 nt is
 an
 i.i.d.
 noise
 process.
 Letting
 the
noise
 go
 to
 zero
 recovers
 the
 deterministic
 version
 of
 Moore’s
 law
in
 either
 case.
 When
 the
 noise
 is
 nonzero,
 however,
 the
 models
behave
 quite
 differently.
 For
 the
 trend
 stationary
 model
 the
 shocks
are
 purely
 transitory,
 i.e.
 they
 do
 not
 accumulate.
 In
 contrast,
 if
 y0
is
 the
 cost
 at
 time
 t
 =
 0,
 Eq.
 (2)
 can
 be
 iterated
 and
 written
 in
 the
form
yt =
 y0 +
 t
 +
t

i=1
ni. 
(3)
This
 is
 equivalent
 to
 Eq.
 (1)
 except
 for
 the
 last
 term.
 While
 in
 the
regression
 model
 of
 Eq.
 (1)
 the
 value
 of
 yt depends
 only
 on
 the
 cur-
rent
 noise
 and
 the
 slope
 ,
 in
 the
 random
 walk
 model
 (Eq.
 (2))
 it
depends
 on
 the
 sum
 of
 previous
 shocks.
 Hence
 shocks
 in
 the
 ran-
dom
 walk
 model
 accumulate
 and
 the
 forecasting
 errors
 grow
 with
time
 horizon
 as
 one
 would
 expect,
 even
 if
 the
 parameters
 of
 the
model
 are
 perfectly
 estimated.9
For
 time
 series
 models
 a
 key
 question
 is
 whether
 the
 process
 has
a
 unit
 root.
 Most
 of
 our
 time
 series
 are
 much
 too
 short
 for
 unit
 root
tests
 to
 be
 effective
 (Blough,
 1992).
 Nonetheless,
 we
 found
 that
 our
time
 series
 forecasts
 are
 consistent
 with
 the
 hypothesis
 of
 a
 unit
root
 and
 that
 they
 perform
 better
 than
 several
 alternatives.
2.2.
 Prediction
 of
 forecast
 errors
We  now
 derive
 a
 formula
 for
 the
 forecast
 errors
 of
 the
 geomet-
ric
 random
 walk
 as
 a
 function
 of
 time
 horizon.
 We  assume
 that
all
 technologies
 follow
 the
 geometric
 random
 walk,
 i.e.
 our
 noisy
version
 of
 Moore’s
 law,
 but
 with
 technology-speciﬁc
 parameters.
Rewriting
 Eq.
 (2)
 slightly,
 it
 becomes
yjt =
 yj,(t−1) +
 j +
 njt,
where
 the
 index
 j
 indicates
 technology
 j.
 For
 convenience
 we
assume
 that
 noise
 njt is
 i.i.d.
 normal,
 i.e.
 njt∼N(0,  K2
j ).
 This
 means
that
 technology
 j
 is
 characterized
 by
 a
 drift
 j and
 the
 standard

 Kj. We
 will
 typically
 not
 include
the
 indices
 for
 the
 technology
 unless
 we  want
 to
 emphasize
 the
dependence
 on
 the
 technology.
We now
 derive
 the
 expected
 error
 distribution
 for
 Eq.
 (2)
 as
 a
function
 of
 the
 time
 horizon
 .
 Eq.
 (2)
 implies
 that
yt+ =
 yt +
 
 +
t+

i=t+1
ni. 
(4)
The
 point
 forecast
  steps
 ahead
 is10
ˆyt+ =
 yt +
 ˆ,
 
(5)
where
 ˆ
 is
 the
 estimated
 .
 The
 forecast
 error
 is
 deﬁned
 as
E
 =
 yt+ −ˆyt+.
(6)
Putting
 Eqs.
 (4)
 and
 (5)
 into
 Eq.
 (6)
 gives
E
 =
 (
 −
 ˆ) +
t+

i=t+1
ni,
 
(7)
which
 separates
 the
 error
 into
 two
 parts.
 The
 ﬁrst
 term
 is
 the
error
 due
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 mean
 is
 an
 estimated
 parameter
 and
the
 second
 term
 represents
 the
 error
 due
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 unpre-
dictable
 random
 shocks
 accumulate
 (Sampson,
 1991).
 Assuming
that
 the
 noise
 increments
 are
 i.i.d
 normal
 and
 that
 the
 estimation
of
 the
 parameters
 is
 based
 on
 a
 trailing
 sample
 of
 m
 data
 points,
 in
Appendix
 B.1
 we  derive
 the
 scaling
 of
 the
 errors
 with
 m,
 
 and ˆK,
where ˆK2 is
 the
 estimated
 variance.
Because
 we  want
 to
 aggregate
 forecast
 errors
 for
 technologies
with
 different
 volatilities,
 to
 study
 how
 the
 errors
 grow
 as
 a
 func-
tion

 use




m

,
 
(8)
where
 E
 represents
 the
 expectation.
This
 formula
 makes
 intuitive
 sense.
 The
 diffusion
 term
 
 is
 due
to
 the
 accumulation
 of
 noisy
 ﬂuctuations
 through
 time.
 This
 term
is
 present
 even
 in
 the
 limit
 m→ ∞,
 where
 the
 estimation
 is
 perfect.
The
 2/m
 term
 is
 due
 to
 estimation
 error
 in
 the
 mean.
 The
 need
to
 estimate
 the
 variance
 causes
 the
 prefactor11 (m
 −
 1)/(m
 −
 3)
 and
also
 means
 that
 the
 distribution
 is

 than
 normal,

with

(10)
Eq.
 (9)
 is
 universal
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 the
 right
 hand
 side
 is
 indepen-
dent
 of
 ˆj, ˆKj, and
 .
 It
 depends
 neither
 on
 the
 properties
 of
 the
technology
 nor
 on
 the
 time
 horizon.
 As
 a
 result
 we
 can
 pool
 fore-
cast
 errors
 for
 different
 technologies
 at
 different
 time
 horizons.
 This

 expected
 logarithm
 of

 cost

 model,
 E[yt+].
 We  assume
 yt+ is
 normally
 distributed.
 This
 means
 the
 cost
 is
log-normally
 distributed
 and
 the
 forecast
 of
 the
 median
 cost
 is
 eE[yt+ ]. Because
 the
mean
 of
 a
 log-normal
 distribution
 also
 depends
 on
 the
 variance
 of
 the
 underlying
normal
 distribution,
 the
 expected
 cost
 diverges
 when
 →
 ∞
 due
 to
 parameter
 uncer-
tainty.
 Our
 forecasts
 here
 are
 for
 the
 median
 cost.
 This
 has
 the
 important
 advantage
that
 (unlike
 the
 mean
 or
 the
 mode)
 it
 does
 not
 require
 an
 estimate
 of
 the
 variance,
and
 is
 therefore
 simpler
 and
 more
 robust.
11 The
 prefactor
 is
 signiﬁcantly
 different
 from
 one
 only
 when
 m
 is
 small.
 Sampson
(1991)
 derived
 the
 same
 formula
 but
 without
 the
 prefactor
 since
 he
 worked
 with
the
 true
 variance.
 Sampson
 (1991)
 also
 showed
 that
 the
 square
 term
 due
 to
 error
 in
the
 estimation
 of
 the
 drift
 exists
 for
 the
 regression
 on
 a
 time
 trend
 model,
 and
 for
more
 general
 noise
 processes.

property
 is
 extremely
 useful
 for
 statistical
 testing
 and
 can
 also
 be
used
 to
 construct
 distributional
 forecasts
 for
 a
 given
 technology.
2.3.
 Generalization
 for
 autocorrelation
We  now
 generalize
 the
 formula
 above
 to
 allow
 for
 autocor-
relations
 in
 the
 error
 terms.
 Although
 the
 uncorrelated
 random
walk
 model
 above
 does
 surprisingly
 well,
 there
 is
 good
 evidence
that
 there
 are
 positive
 autocorrelations
 in
 the
 data.
 In
 order
 to
incorporate
 this
 structure
 we
 extend
 the
 results
 above
 for
 an
ARIMA(0,1,1)
 (autoregressive
 integrated
 moving
 average)
 model.
The
 zero
 indicates
 that
 we
 do
 not
 use
 the
 autoregressive
 part,
 so
we
 will
 abbreviate
 this
 as
 an
 IMA(1,1)
 model
 in
 what
 follows.
 The
IMA(1,1)
 model
 is
 of
 the
 form
yt −
 yt−1 =
 
 +
 vt +
 vt−1,
 
(11)
with
 the
 noise
 vt∼N(0,  2).
 This
 model
 is
 also
 a
 geometric
 random
walk,
 but
 with
 correlated
 increments
 when
 
 /= 0
 (the
 autocorre-
lations
 of
 the
 time
 series
 are
 positive
 when
 
 >
 0).
We
 chose
 this
 model
 rather
 than
 other
 alternatives
 mainly
 for
its
 simplicity12. Moreover,
 our
 data
 are
 often
 time-aggregated,
 that
is,
 our
 yearly
 observations
 are
 averages
 of
 the
 observed
 costs
 over
the
 year.
 It
 has
 been
 shown
 that
 if
 the
 true
 process
 is
 a
 random
 walk
with
 drift
 then
 aggregation
 can
 lead
 to
 substantial
 autocorrela-
tion
 (Working,
 1960).
 In
 any
 case,
 while
 every
 technology
 certainly
follows
 an
 idiosyncratic
 pattern
 and
 may
 have
 a
 complex
 auto-
correlation
 structure
 and
 speciﬁc
 measurement
 errors,
 using
 the
IMA(1,1)
 as
 a
 universal
 model
 allows
 us
 to
 parsimoniously
 under-
stand
 the
 empirical
 forecast
 errors
 and
 generate
 robust
 prediction
intervals.
A
 key
 quantity
 for
 pooling
 the
 data
 is
 the
 variance,
 which
 by
analogy
 with
 the
 previous
 model
 we
 call
 K
 for
 this
 model
 as
 well.
It
 is
 easy
 to
 show
 that
K2 ≡
 var(yt −
 yt−1)
 =
 var(vt +
 vt−1) =
 (1
 +
 2)2,
see
 e.g.
 Box
 and
 Jenkins
 (1970). The
 relevant
 formulas
 for
 this
 case
are
 derived
 in
 Appendix
 B.2. We  make
 the
 same
 point
 forecasts
 as
before
 given
 by
 Eq.
 (5). If
 the
 variance
 is
 known
 the
 distribution
 of
forecast
 errors
 is
E∼N(0, 2A∗),
 
(12)
with
A∗=
 −2
 +

1
 + 2(m
 −
 1)
m
+ 2

 

 + 2
m

. 
(13)
Note
 that
 we
 recover
 Eq.
 (10)
 when
 
 =
 0.
 In
 the
 usual
 case
 where
 the
variance
 has
 to
 be
 estimated,
 we
 derive
 an
 approximate
 formula
 for
the
 growth
 and
 distribution
 of
 the
 forecast
 errors
 by
 assuming
 that
ˆK
 and
 E
 are
 independent.
 The
 expected
 mean
 squared
 normalized
error
 is
()
 ≡
 E
 E
ˆK
2
= m
 −

m
 −

A∗

(14)
and
 the
 distribution
 of
 rescaled
 normalized
 forecast
 errors
 is
∗=
1
	
A∗/(1
 +
 2)
 E
ˆK

∼t(m
 −

(15)
These
 formulas
 are
 only
 approximations
 so
 we  compare
 them
 to
more
 exact
 results
 obtained
 through
 simulations
 in
 Appendix
 B.2
 –
12 Our
 individual
 time
 series
 are
 very
 short,
 which
 makes
 it
 very
 difﬁcult
 to
 ﬁnd
 the
proper
 order
 of
 differencing
 and
 to
 distinguish
 between
 different
 ARMA
 models.
 For
instance,
 slightly
 different
 ARIMA
 models
 such
 as
 (1,1,0)
 are
 far
 from
 implausible
for
 many
 technologies.
see
 in
 particular
 Fig.
 12. For
 m
 >
 30
 the
 approximation
 is
 excellent,
but
 there
 are
 discrepancies
 for
 small
 values
 of
 m.
As
 before
 the
 right
 hand
 side
 is
 independent
 of
 all
 the
 parame-
ters
 of
 the
 technology
 as
 well
 as
 the
 time
 horizon.
 Eq.
 (15)
 can
 be
viewed
 as
 the
 distribution
 of
 errors
 around
 a
 point
 forecast,
 which
makes
 it
 possible
 to
 collapse
 many
 technologies
 onto
 a
 single
 distri-
bution.
 This
 property
 is
 extremely
 useful
 for
 statistical
 testing,
 i.e.
for
 determining
 the
 quality
 of
 the
 model.
 But
 its
 greatest
 use,
 as
 we
demonstrate
 in
 Section
 6, is
 that
 it
 makes
 it
 possible
 to
 formulate
 a
distributional
 forecast
 for
 the
 future
 costs
 of
 a
 given
 technology.
When
 m
 is
 sufﬁciently
 large
 the
 Student
 t distribution
 is
 well-
approximated
 by
 a
 standard
 normal.
 Using
 the
 mean
 given
 by
 Eq.
(5)
 and
 the
 variance
 determined
 by
 Eqs.
 ((12
 and
 13)),
 the
 distribu-
tional
 forecast
 for
 the
 future
 logarithm
 of
 the
 cost
 yt+ conditioned
on
 (yt, . . .,  yt−m+1) is13
yt+∼N(yt +
 ˆ, ˆK2A∗/(1
 +
 2)).

We
 will
 return
 later
 to
 the

 of

2.4.
 Alternative
 hypotheses
In
 addition
 to
 autocorrelation
 we  investigated
 other
 ways
 to
generalize
 the
 model,
 such
 as
 heavy
 tails
 and
 long-memory.
 As
 dis-
cussed
 in
 Appendix
 C.4, based
 on
 forecast
 errors
 we
 found
 little
evidence
 for
 heavy
 tails.
 Long-memory
 is
 in
 a
 sense
 an
 extreme
version
 of
 the
 autocorrelation
 hypothesis,14 which
 produces
 errors
that
 grow
 faster
 as
 a
 function
 of
 the
 forecasting
 horizon
 
 than
 a
random
 walk.
 Given
 that
 long-memory
 is
 a
 natural
 result
 of
 nonsta-
tionarity,
 which
 is
 commonly
 associated
 with
 technological
 change,
our
 prior
 was
 that
 it
 was
 a
 highly
 plausible
 alternative.
 However,
 as
we
 will
 see,
 the
 geometric
 random
 walk
 with
 normal
 noise
 incre-
ments
 and
 autocorrelations
 seems
 to
 give
 good
 agreement
 for
 the
time
 scaling
 of
 forecasting
 errors,
 so
 we
 did
 not
 investigate
 long-
memory
 further.

 Data
3.1.
 Data
 collection
The
 bulk
 of
 our
 data
 on
 technology
 costs
 comes
 from
 the
 Santa
Fe
 Institute’s
 Performance
 Curve
 DataBase,15 which
 was
 originally
developed
 by
 Bela
 Nagy
 and
 collaborators;
 we
 augment
 it
 with
 a
few
 other
 datasets.
 These
 data
 were
 collected
 via
 literature
 search,
with
 the
 principal
 criterion
 for
 selection
 being
 availability.
 Fig.
 2
plots
 the
 time
 series
 for
 each
 data
 set.
 The
 motley
 character
 of
 our
dataset
 is
 clear:
 the
 time
 series
 for
 different
 technologies
 are
 of
different
 lengths
 and
 they
 start
 and
 stop
 at
 different
 times.
 The
sharp
 cutoff
 for
 the
 chemical
 data,
 for
 example,
 reﬂects
 the
 fact
 that
it
 comes
 from
 a
 book
 published
 by
 the
 Boston
 Consulting
 Group
 in
Boston
 Consulting
 Group
 (1972). Table
 1
 gives
 a
 summary
 of
 the
properties
 of
 the
 data
 and
 more
 description
 of
 the
 sources
 can
 be
found
 in
 Appendix
 A. This
 plot
 also
 makes
 it
 clear
 that
 technologies
improve
 at
 very
 different
 rates.
13 Note
 that
 although
 we
 make
 the
 estimate
 of
 the
 variance
 -dependent,
 we
always
 use
 the
 estimate
 of
 the
 mean
 corresponding
 to
 
 = 0.
 We do
 this
 because
this
 is
 simpler
 and
 more
 robust.
14 A
 process
 has
 long-memory
 if the
 autocorrelation
 function
 of
 its
 increments
is
 not
 integrable.
 Under
 the
 long-memory
 hypothesis
 one
 expects
 the
 diffusion
term
 of
 the
 normalized
 squared
 errors
 to
 scale
 as
 ()
 ∼
 2H,  where
 H
 is
 the
 Hurst
exponent.
 In
 the
 absence
 of
 long-memory
 H
 =
 1/2,
 but
 for
 long-memory
 1/2
 < H
 < 1.
Long-memory
 can
 arise
 from
 many
 causes,
 including
 nonstationarity.
 It
 is
 easy
 to
construct
 plausible
 processes
 with
 the
 
 parameter
 varying
 where
 the
 mean
 squared
errors
 grow
 faster
 than
 2.

A
 ubiquitous
 problem
 in
 forecasting
 technological
 progress
 is
ﬁnding
 invariant
 units.
 A
 favorable
 example
 is
 electricity.
 The
 cost
of
 generating
 electricity
 can
 be
 measured
 in
 dollars
 per
 kWh,
 mak-
ing
 it
 possible
 to
 sensibly
 compare
 competing
 technologies
 and
measure
 their
 progress
 through
 time.
 Even
 in
 this
 favorable
 exam-
ple,
 however,
 making
 electricity
 cleaner
 and
 safer
 has
 a
 cost,
 which
has
 affected
 historical
 prices
 for
 technologies
 such
 as
 coal
 and
nuclear
 power
 in
 recent
 years,
 and
 means
 that
 their
 costs
 are

 that

 A.
difﬁcult
 to
 compare
 to
 clean
 and
 safe
 but
 intermittent
 sources
 of
power
 such
 as
 solar
 energy.
 To
 take
 an
 unfavorable
 example,
 our
dataset
 contains
 appliances
 such
 as
 television
 sets,
 that
 have
 dra-
matically
 increased
 in
 quality
 through
 time.16 Yet
 another
 problem
is
 that
 some
 of
 them
 are
 potentially
 subject
 to
 scarcity
 constraints,
which
 might
 potentially
 introduce
 additional
 trends
 and
 ﬂuctua-
tions.
One
 should
 therefore
 regard
 our
 results
 here
 as
 a
 lower
 bound
on
 what
 is
 possible,
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 performing
 the
 analysis
 with
better
 data
 in
 which
 all
 technologies
 had
 invariant
 units
 would
 very
likely
 improve
 the
 quality
 of
 the
 forecasts.
 We  would
 love
 to
 be
able
 to
 make
 appropriate
 normalizations
 but
 the
 work
 involved
 is
prohibitive;
 if
 we
 dropped
 all
 questionable
 examples
 we
 would
 end
with
 little
 remaining
 data.
 Most
 of
 the
 data
 are
 costs,
 but
 in
 a
 few
cases
 they
 are
 prices;
 again,
 this
 adds
 noise
 but
 if
 we
 were
 able
 to
be
 consistent
 that
 should
 only
 improve
 our
 results.
 We  have
 done
various
 tests
 removing
 data
 and
 the
 basic
 results
 are
 not
 sensitive
 to
what
 is
 included
 and
 what
 is
 omitted
 (see
 Fig.
 14
 in
 the
 appendix).
We
 have
 removed
 some
 technologies
 that
 are
 too
 similar
 to
 each
other
 from
 the
 Performance
 Curve
 Database.
 For
 instance,
 when
we
 have
 two
 datasets
 for
 the
 same
 technology,
 we  keep
 only
 one
of
 them.
 Our
 choice
 was
 based
 on
 data
 quality
 and
 length
 of
 the
time
 series.
 This
 selection
 left
 us
 with
 66
 technologies
 belonging
to
 different
 sectors
 that
 we
 label
 as
 chemistry,
 genomics,
 energy,
hardware,
 consumer
 durables
 and
 food.
3.2.
 Data
 selection
 and
 descriptive
 statistics
In
 this
 paper
 we
 are
 interested
 in
 technologies
 that
 are
 improv-
ing,
 so
 we
 restrict
 our
 analysis
 to
 those
 technologies
 whose
 rate
 of
improvement
 is
 statistically
 signiﬁcant
 based
 on
 the
 available
 sam-
ple.
 We  used
 a
 simple
 one-sided
 t-test
 on
 the
 ﬁrst-difference
 (log)
series
 and
 removed
 all
 technologies
 for
 which
 the
 p-value
 indicates
that
 we
 cannot
 reject
 the
 null
 that
 j =
 0
 at
 a
 10%
 conﬁdence
 level.17
16 Gordon
 (1990)
 provides
 quality
 change
 adjustments
 for
 a number
 of
 durable
goods.
 These
 methods
 (typically
 hedonic
 regressions)
 require
 additional
 data.
17 This
 is
 under
 the
 assumption
 that
 
 =
 0.
Table
 1
 reports
 the
 p-values
 for
 the
 one
 sided
 t-tests
 and
 the
bottom
 of
 the
 table
 shows
 the
 technologies
 that
 are
 excluded
 as
 a
result.
 Table
 1
 also
 shows
 the
 estimated
 drift
 ˜j and
 the
 estimated
standard
 deviation ˜Kj based
 on
 the
 full
 sample
 for
 each
 technology
 j.
(Throughout
 the
 paper
 we
 use
 a
 hat
 to
 denote
 estimates
 performed
within
 an
 estimation
 window
 of
 size
 m
 and
 a
 tilde
 to
 denote
 the
estimates
 made
 using
 the
 full
 sample).
 Histograms
 of
 ˜j, ˜Kj, sample
size
 Tj and ˜j are
 given18 in
 Fig.

 Relation
 between
 drift
 and
 volatility
Fig.
 4
 shows
 a
 scatter
 plot
 of
 the
 estimated
 standard
 deviation ˜Kj
for
 technology
 j vs.
 the
 estimated
 improvement
 rate
 −
 ˜j. A
 linear
 ﬁt
gives ˜K =
 0.02
 −
 0.76
 ˜
 with
 R2 =
 0.87
 and
 standard
 errors
 of
 0.008
for
 the
 intercept
 and
 0.04
 for
 the
 slope,
 as
 shown
 in
 the
 ﬁgure.
A
 log-log
 ﬁt
 gives ˜K =
 e−0.68(−
 ˜)0.72 with
 R2 =
 0.73
 and
 standard
errors
 for
 the
 scaling
 constant
 of
 0.18
 and
 for
 the
 exponent
 of
 0.06.
This
 indicates
 that
 on
 average
 the
 uncertainty ˜Kj gets
 bigger
 as
 the
improvement
 rate
 −
 ˜j increases.
 There
 is
 no
 reason
 that
 we
 are
aware
 of
 to
 expect
 this
 a
 priori.
 One
 possible
 interpretation
 is
 that
for
 technological
 investment
 there
 is
 a
 trade-off
 between
 risk
 and
returns.
 Another
 possibility
 is
 that
 faster
 improvement
 ampliﬁes
ﬂuctuations.
4.
 Estimation
 procedures
4.1.
 Statistical
 validation
We use
 hindcasting
 for
 statistical
 validation,
 i.e.
 for
 each
 tech-
nology
 we
 pretend
 to
 be
 at
 a
 given
 date
 in
 the
 past
 and
 make
forecasts
 for
 dates
 in
 the
 future
 relative
 to
 the
 chosen
 date.19 We
have
 chosen
 this
 procedure
 for
 several
 reasons.
 First,
 it
 directly
 tests
the
 predictive
 power
 of
 the
 model
 rather
 than
 its
 goodness
 of
 ﬁt
 to
the
 data,
 and
 so
 is
 resistant
 to
 overﬁtting.
 Second,
 it
 mimics
 the
same
 procedure
 that
 one
 would
 follow
 in
 making
 real
 predictions,
and
 third,
 it
 makes
 efﬁcient
 use
 of
 the
 data
 available
 for
 testing.
We
 ﬁt
 the
 model
 at
 each
 time
 step
 to
 the
 m
 most
 recent
 changes
in
 cost
 (i.e.
 the
 most
 recent
 m
 +
 1
 years
 of
 data).
 We  use
 the
 same
value
 of
 m
 for
 all
 technologies
 and
 for
 all
 forecasts.
 Because
 most
 of
the
 time
 series
 in
 our
 dataset
 are
 quite
 short,
 and
 because
 we
 are
more
 concerned
 here
 with
 testing
 the
 procedure
 we
 have
 devel-
oped
 rather
 than
 with
 making
 optimal
 forecasts,
 unless
 otherwise
noted
 we  choose
 m
 =
 5.
 This
 is
 admittedly
 very
 small,
 but
 it
 has
 the
advantage
 that
 it
 allows
 us
 to
 make
 a
 large
 number
 of
 forecasts.
 We
will
 return
 later
 to
 discuss
 the
 question
 of
 which
 value
 of
 m
 makes
the
 best
 forecasts.
We  perform
 hindcasting
 exhaustively
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 we
 make
as
 many
 forecasts
 as
 possible
 given
 the
 choice
 of
 m.
 For
 technology
j,
 the
 cost
 data
 yt =
 log
 pt exists
 in
 years
 t
 =
 1,
 2,
 . . .,  Tj. We
 then
 make
forecasts
 for
 each
 feasible
 year
 and
 each
 feasible
 time
 horizon,
 i.e.
we
 make
 forecasts ˆyt0+(t0) rooted
 in
 years
 t0 =
 (m
 +
 1,
 . . .,  Tj −
 1)
with
 forecast
 horizon
 
 =
 (1,
 . . .,  Tj −
 t0).
Since
 our
 dataset
 includes
 technology
 time
 series
 of
 different
length
 (see
 Table
 1
 and
 Fig.
 2)
 the
 number
 of
 possible
 forecasts
that
 can
 be
 made
 with
 a
 given
 historical
 window
 m
 is
 highest
 for
 =
 1
 and
 decreases
 for
 longer
 horizons.20 Fig.
 5
 shows
 the
 total
number
 of
 possible
 forecasts
 that
 can
 be
 made
 with
 our
 dataset
 at
18 The ˜j are
 estimated
 by
 maximum
 likelihood
 letting
 ˆMLE be
 different
 from
 ˆ.
19 This
 method
 is
 also
 sometimes
 called
 backtesting
 and
 is
 a
 form
 of
 cross-
validation.
20 The
 number
 of
 possible
 forecasts
 that
 can
 be
 made
 using
 a technology
 time
series
 of
 length
 Tj is
 [Tj −
 (m
 + 1)][Tj −
 m]/2
 which
 is
 O(T2
j ).
 Hence
 the
 total
 number
of
 forecast
 errors
 contributed
 by
 a
 given
 technology
 time
 series
 is
 disproportionately
dependent
 on
 its
 length.
 However,
 we
 have
 checked
 that
 aggregating

 that
 are
 long
 enough
to
 make
 at
 least
 one

 at
 a

 which

 that

 The

 at
 
 =
 20
 years
 indicates
 our
 (somewhat
 arbitrary)
choice
 of
 a
 maximum
 time
 horizon.
(see
 Appendix
 C.3).
 There
 are
 a
 total
 of
 8212
 possible
 forecasts
 that
can
 be
 made
 with
 an
 historical
 window
 of
 m
 =
 5,
 and
 6391
 forecasts
that
 can
 be
 made
 with
 
 ≤

To
 test
 for
 statistical
 signiﬁcance
 we
 use
 a
 surrogate
 data
procedure
 (explained
 below).
 There
 are
 three
 reasons
 for
 doing
this:
 The
 ﬁrst
 is
 that,
 although
 we  derived
 approximate
 formu-
las
 for
 the
 forecast
 errors
 in
 Eqs.
 (14)
 and
 (15), when

approximation
 is
 not
 very
 good
 for
 m
 =
 5.
 The
 second
 is
 that
 the
rolling
 window
 approach
 we
 use
 for
 hindcasting
 implies
 overlaps
in
 both
 the
 historical
 sample
 used
 to
 estimate
 parameters
 at
 each
time
 t0 and
 overlapping
 intervals
 in
 the
 future
 for
 horizons
 with

 >
 1.
 This
 implies
 substantial
 correlation
 in
 the
 empirical
 fore-
cast
 errors,
 which
 complicates
 statistical
 testing.
 The
 third
 reason
is
 that,
 even
 if
 the
 formulas
 were
 exact,
 we
 expect
 ﬁnite
 sample
ﬂuctuations.
 That
 is,
 with
 a
 limited
 number
 of
 technologies
 and
short
 time
 series,
 we
 do
 not
 expect
 to
 ﬁnd
 the
 predicted
 result
exactly;
 the
 question
 is
 then
 whether
 the
 deviation
 that
 we  observe
is
 consistent
 with
 what
 is
 expected.
 The
 surrogate
 data
 procedure
estimates
 a
 null
 distribution
 for
 the
 normalized
 mean
 squared
 fore-
cast
 error
 under
 the
 hypothesized
 model.
 This
 is
 done
 by
 simulating
both
 the
 model
 and
 the
 forecasting
 procedure
 to
 create
 a
 replica
of
 the
 dataset
 and
 the
 forecasts.
 This
 is
 repeated
 for
 many
 differ-
ent
 realizations
 of
 the
 noise
 process
 in
 order
 to
 generate
 the
 null
distribution.
 More
 speciﬁcally,
 for
 each
 technology
 we
 generate
 Tj
pseudo
 cost
 data
 points
 using
 Eq.
 (11)
 with
 
 =
 ˜j, K
 = ˜Kj and
 a
given
 value
 of
 ,
 thereby
 mimicking
 the
 structure
 of
 the
 data
 set.
We
 then
 estimate
 the
 parameters
 and
 perform
 hindcasting
 just
 as
we
 did
 for
 the
 real
 data,
 generating
 the
 same
 number
 of
 forecasts
and
 computing
 the
 mean
 squared
 forecast
 error.
 This
 process
 is
then
 repeated
 many
 times
 with
 different
 random
 number
 seeds
 to
estimate
 the
 distribution.
 This
 same
 method
 can
 be
 used
 to
 esti-
mate
 expected
 deviations
 for
 any
 quantity,
 e.g.
 we
 also
 use
 this
 to
estimate
 the
 expected
 deviation
 of
 the
 ﬁnite
 sample
 distribution
from
 the
 predicted
 distribution
 of
 forecast
 errors.
4.2.
 Parameter
 estimation
We
 estimate
 the
 mean
 and
 the
 variance
 for
 each
 technology
dynamically,
 using
 a
 rolling
 window
 approach
 to
 ﬁt
 the
 parameters
based
 on
 the
 m
 +
 1
 most
 recent
 data
 points.
 In
 each
 year
 t0 for
 which
forecasts
 are
 made
 the
 drift
 ˆt0 is
 estimated
 as
 the
 sample
 mean
 of
the
 ﬁrst
 differences,
ˆt0 = 1
m
t0−1

i=t0−m
(yi+1 −
 yi)
 = yt0 −
 yt0−m
m
,  
(17)
where
 the
 last
 equality
 follows
 from
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 sum
 is
 tele-
scopic,
 and
 implies
 that
 only
 two
 points
 are
 needed
 to
 estimate
 the
drift.
 The
 volatility
 is
 estimated
 using
 the
 unbiased
 estimator21
ˆK2
t0 =
1
m
 −
 1
t0−1

i=t0−m
[(yi+1 −
 yi) −
 ˆt0]2.
(18)
This
 procedure
 gives
 us
 a
 variable
 number
 of
 forecasts
 for
 each
 tech-
nology
 j and
 time
 horizon
 
 rooted
 at
 all
 feasible
 times
 t0.
 We  record
the
 forecasting
 errors
 Et0, =
 yt+(t0) −ˆyt+(t0) and
 the
 associated
values
 of ˆKt0 for
 all
 t0 and
 all
 
 where
 we
 can
 make
 forecasts.
The
 autocorrelation
 parameter
 
 for
 the
 generalized
 model
 has
to
 be
 treated
 differently.
 Our
 time
 series
 are
 simply
 too
 short
 to
make
 reasonable
 rolling
 window,
 technology-speciﬁc
 estimates
 for
.
 With
 such
 small
 values
 of
 m
 the
 estimated
 autocorrelations
 are
highly
 unreliable.
Our
 solution
 is
 to
 use
 a
 global
 value
 of
 ,
 i.e.
 we  use
 the
 same
value
 for
 all
 technologies
 and
 all
 points
 in
 time.
 It
 may
 well
 be
 that

 is
 technology
 speciﬁc,
 but
 given
 the
 short
 amount
 of
 data
 it
 is
 nec-
essary
 to
 make
 a
 choice
 that
 performs
 well
 under
 forecasting.
 This
21 This
 is
 different
 from
 the
 maximum
 likelihood
 estimator,
 which
 does
 not
 make
use
 of
 Bessel’s
 correction
 (i.e.
 dividing
 by
 (m
 −
 1)
 instead
 of
 m).
 Our
 choice
 is
 driven
by
 the
 fact
 that
 in
 practice
 we
 use
 a
 very
 small
 m,
 making
 the
 bias
 of
 the
 maximum
likelihood
 estimator
 rather
 large.
is
 a
 classic
 bias-variance
 trade-off,
 where
 the
 variance
 introduced
by
 statistical
 estimation
 of
 a
 parameter
 is
 so
 large
 that
 the
 forecasts
produced
 by
 a
 biased
 model
 with
 this
 parameter
 ﬁxed
 are
 superior.
With
 very
 long
 time
 series
 this
 could
 potentially
 be
 avoided.
 This
procedure
 seems
 to
 work
 well.
 It
 leaves
 us
 with
 a
 parameter
 that
has
 to
 be
 estimated
 in-sample,
 but
 since
 this
 is
 only
 one
 parameter
estimated
 from
 a
 sample
 of
 more
 than
 6,000
 forecasts
 the
 resulting
estimate
 should
 be
 reasonably
 reliable.
Evidence
 concerning
 autocorrelations
 is
 given
 in
 Fig.
 3, where
we
 present
 a
 histogram
 for
 the
 values
 of ˜j for
 each
 technology
 j
based
 on
 the
 full
 sample.
 The
 results
 are
 highly
 variable.
 Excluding
eight
 likely
 outliers
 where ˜j =
 ±1,
 the
 mean
 across
 the
 sample
is
 0.27,
 and
 35
 out
 of
 the
 remaining
 45
 improving
 technologies
have
 positive
 values
 of ˜j. This
 seems
 to
 suggest
 that
 
 tends
 to
be
 positive.
We
 use
 two
 different
 methods
 for
 estimating
 a
 global
 value
 of
.
 The
 ﬁrst
 method
 takes
 advantage
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 magnitude
of
 the
 forecast
 errors
 is
 an
 increasing
 function
 of
  (we
 assume

 >
 0)
 and
 chooses
 m (m
 as
 in
 “matched”)
 to
 match
 the
 empirically
observed
 forecast
 errors,
 leading
 to
 m =
 0.63
 as
 described
 in
 the
next
 section.
 The
 second
 method
 takes
 a
 weighted
 average
 w (w
as
 in
 “weighted”)
 calculated
 as
 follows.
 We
 exclude
 all
 technologies
for
 which
 the
 estimate
 of
 
 reveals
 speciﬁcation
 or
 estimation
 issues
(
 ≈
 1
 or
 
 ≈
 −1).
 Then
 at
 each
 horizon
 we  compute
 a
 weighted
 aver-
age,
 with
 the
 weights
 proportional
 to
 the
 number
 of
 forecasts
 made
with
 that
 technology.
 Finally
 we
 take
 the
 average
 of
 the
 ﬁrst
 20
horizon-speciﬁc
 estimated
 values
 of
 ,
 leading
 to
 w =
 0.25.
 See
Appendix
 D.

 Comparison
 of
 models
 to
 data
In
 comparing
 the
 model
 to
 data
 we
 address
 the
 following
 ﬁve
questions:
1.
 Is
 the
 scaling
 law
 for
 the
 increase
 in
 forecasting
 errors
 as
 a
 func-
tion
 of
 time
 derived
 in
 Eqs.
 (8)
 and
 (14)
 consistent
 with
 the
data?
2.
 Does
 there
 exist
 a
 value
 of
 
 such
 that
 the
 null
 hypothesis
 of
 the
model
 is
 not
 rejected?
 If
 so,
 what
 is
 this
 value,
 and
 how
 strong
is
 the
 evidence
 that
 it
 is
 positive?
3.
 When
 the
 normalized
 errors
 for
 different
 technologies
 at
 differ-
ent
 time
 horizons
 are
 collapsed
 onto
 a
 single
 distribution,
 does
this
 agree
 with
 the
 Student
 distribution
 as
 predicted
 by
 Eq.
 (15)?
4.
 Do
 the
 errors
 scale
 with
 the
 trailing
 sample
 size
 m
 as
 predicted
under
 the
 assumption
 that
 the
 random
 process
 is
 stationary
 (i.e.
that
 parameters
 are
 not
 changing
 in
 time)?
5.
 Is
 the
 model
 well-speciﬁed?
We will
 see
 that
 we
 get
 clear
 afﬁrmative
 answers
 to
 the
 ﬁrst
 four
questions
 but
 we  are
 unable
 to
 answer
 question
 (5).
5.1.
 Normalized
 forecast
 errors
 as
 a
 function
 of
 
To
 answer
 the
 ﬁrst
 question
 we
 compute
 the
 sample
 estimate
 of
the
 mean
 squared
 normalized
 forecast
 error
 (),
 averaging
 over
all
 available
 forecasts
 for
 all
 technologies
 at
 each
 time
 horizon
 with

 ≤
 20
 (see
 Eq.
 (14)).
 Fig.
 6
 compares
 the
 empirical
 results
 to
 the
model
 with
 three
 different
 values
 of
 the
 autocorrelation
 parame-
ter
 .
 Because
 the
 approximate
 error
 estimates
 derived
 in
 Eq.
 (14)
break
 down
 for
 small
 values
 of
 m,
 for
 each
 value
 of
 
 we
 estimate
the
 expected
 mean
 squared
 errors
 under
 the
 null
 hypothesis
 of
 the
model
 via
 the
 surrogate
 data
 procedure
 described
 in
 Section
 4.1.22
22 When
 
 =
 0
 the
 simulated
 and
 analytical
 results
 are
 visually
 indistiguishable.

 formula,

 The

 of
the
 normalised
 error
 () is
 shown
 by
 black
 dots.
 The
 grey
 area
 corresponds
 to
 the
95%
 conﬁdence
 intervals
 for
 the
 case
 
 = m.
 The
 dashed
 line
 represents
 the

 normalized

 with
 
 = 0,
 the
 dot-dash
 line
 is
 for
 w =
 0.25
 and
 the
 solid
line
 is
 for
 m =
 0.63.
The
 model
 does
 a
 good
 job
 of
 predicting
 the
 scaling
 of
 the
 fore-
cast
 errors
 as
 a
 function
 of
 the
 time
 horizon
 .
 The
 errors
 are
predicted
 to
 grow
 approximately
 proportional
 to
 (
 +
 2/m); at
 long
horizons
 the
 error
 growth
 at
 each
 value
 of
 
 closely
 parallels
 that
for
 the
 empirical
 forecasts.
 This
 suggests
 that
 this
 scaling
 is
 cor-
rect,
 and
 that
 there
 is
 no
 strong
 support
 for
 modiﬁcations
 such
 as
long-memory
 that
 would
 predict
 alternative
 rates
 of
 error
 growth.
Using
 m =
 0.63
 gives
 a
 good
 match
 to
 the
 empirical
 data
 across
the
 entire
 range
 of
 time
 horizons.
 Note
 that
 even
 though
 we  chose
m in
 order
 to
 get
 the
 best
 possible
 match,
 given
 that
 we  are
 rescal-
ing
 data
 for
 different
 technologies
 by
 the
 empirically
 measured
sample
 standard
 deviations
 over
 very
 short
 samples
 of
 length
 m
 =
 5,
and
 that
 we
 are
 predicting
 across
 20
 different
 time
 horizons
 simul-
taneously,
 the
 ability
 to
 ﬁnd
 a
 value
 of
 the
 parameter
 
 that
 matches
this
 well
 was
 far
 from
 guaranteed
 (It
 is
 completely
 possible,
 for
example,
 that
 there
 would
 simply
 not
 exist
 a
 value
 of
 
 <
 1
 yielding
errors
 that
 were
 sufﬁciently
 large.).
To
 test
 the
 statistical
 signiﬁcance
 of
 the
 results
 for
 different
 val-
ues
 of
 
 and
 
 we
 use
 the
 surrogate
 data
 procedure
 described
 at
 the
end
 of
 Section
 4.1. For
 m =
 0.63
 we
 indicate
 error
 bars
 by
 showing
in
 grey
 the
 region
 containing
 the
 95%
 of
 the
 simulated
 realizations
with
 errors
 closest
 to
 the
 mean.
 For
 
 =
 1
 and
 
 =
 2
 the
 predicted
errors
 are
 visibly
 below
 the
 empirical
 observations,
 but
 the
 dif-
ference
 is
 within
 the
 error
 bars
 (though
 on
 the
 edge
 of
 the
 error
bars
 for
 
 =
 1);
 the
 agreement
 is
 very
 good
 at
 all
 other
 values
 of
 .
The
 autocorrelation
 parameter
 w =
 0.25
 is
 weakly
 rejected
 for
 
between
 1
 and
 6
 and
 weakly
 accepted
 elsewhere,
 indicating
 that
it
 is
 very
 roughly
 the
 lowest
 value
 of
 
 that
 is
 consistent
 with
 the
data
 at
 the
 two
 standard
 deviations
 level.
 In
 contrast
 the
 case
 
 =
 0,
which
 gives
 normalized
 error
 predictions
 that
 are
 lower
 by
 about
a
 factor
 of
 two,
 is
 clearly
 well
 outside
 of
 the
 error
 bars
 (note
 the
logarithmic
 scale).
 This
 strongly
 indicates
 that
 a
 positive
 value
 of
 
is
 required
 to
 match
 the
 observed
 errors,
 satisfying
 
 >
 w =
 0.25.
5.2.
 Distribution
 of
 forecast
 errors
We  now
 address
 question
 (3)
 by
 testing
 whether
 we  correctly
predict
 the
 distribution
 of
 forecast
 errors.

 the
 errors.
 Different
 values
 of

 plotted
 separately,
 and
each
 is
 compared
 to
 the
 predicted
 Student
 distribution.
 Overall,
 the
ﬁt
 is
 good
 but
 at
 longer
 horizons
 forecast
 errors
 tend
 to
 be
 positive,
that
 is,
 realized
 technological
 progress
 is
 slightly
 slower
 than
 pre-
dicted.
 We  have
 tested
 to
 see
 if
 this
 forecast
 bias
 is
 signiﬁcant,
 and
for
 
 ≤
 11
 we  cannot
 reject
 the
 null
 that
 there
 is
 no
 bias
 even
 at
 the
10%
 level.
 At
 higher
 horizons
 there
 is
 evidence
 of
 forecast
 bias,
 but
we
 have
 to
 remember
 that
 at
 these
 horizons
 we  have
 much
 less
data
 (and
 fewer
 technologies)
 available
 for
 testing.

 the

To
 test
 whether
 the
 observed
 deviations
 of
 the
 empirical
 error
distribution
 from
 the
 predicted
 distribution
 are
 signiﬁcant
 we
 once
again
 use
 the
 surrogate
 data
 approach
 described
 at
 the
 end
 of
 Sec-
tion
 4.1. As
 before
 we  generate
 many
 replicas
 of
 the
 dataset
 and
forecasts.
 For
 each
 replica
 of
 the
 dataset
 and
 forecasts
 we
 compute
a
 set
 of
 renormalized
 errors
 * and
 construct
 their
 distribution.
 We
then
 measure
 the
 average
 distance
 between
 the
 surrogate
 distri-
bution
 and
 the
 Student
 distribution
 as
 described
 in
 Appendix
 E.
Repeating
 this
 process
 10,000
 times
 results
 in
 the
 sampling
 distri-
bution
 of
 the
 deviations
 from
 the
 Student
 distribution
 under
 the
null
 hypothesis
 that
 the
 model
 is
 correct.
 We  then
 compare
 this
to
 the
 corresponding
 value
 of
 the
 average
 distance
 between
 the
real
 data
 and
 the
 Student
 distribution,
 which
 gives
 us
 a
 p-value
under
 the
 null
 hypothesis.
 We  ﬁnd
 that
 the
 model
 with
 m =
 0.63
is
 accepted.
 In
 contrast
 w =
 0.25
 is
 rejected
 with
 p-values
 ran-
ging
 from
 1%
 to
 0.1%,
 depending
 on
 the
 way
 in
 which
 the
 average
distance
 is
 computed.
 The
 case
 with
 
 =
 0
 is
 very
 strongly
 rejected.
These
 results
 make
 it
 clear
 that
 the
 positive
 autocorrelations
are
 both
 statistically
 signiﬁcant
 and
 important.
 The
 statistical
 test-
ing
 shows
 that
 
 =
 0.63
 provides
 a
 good
 estimate
 for
 the
 observed
forecasting
 errors
 across
 a
 large
 range
 of
 time
 horizons,
 with
 nor-
malized
 forecasting
 errors
 that
 are
 well-described
 by
 the
 Student
distribution.
5.3.
 Dependence
 on
 sample
 size
 m
So
 far
 we
 have
 used
 only
 a
 small
 fraction
 of
 the
 data
 to
 make
 each
forecast.
 The
 choice
 for
 the
 trailing
 sample
 of
 m
 =
 5
 was
 for
 testing
purposes,
 allowing
 us
 to
 generate
 a
 large
 number
 of
 forecasts
 and
test
 our
 method
 for
 estimating
 their
 accuracy.
We now
 address
 the
 question
 of
 the
 optimal
 value
 of
 m.
 If
 the
process
 is
 stationary
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 the
 parameters
 (,
 K,
 )
 are
constant,
 one
 should
 always
 use
 the
 largest
 possible
 value
 of
 m.
If
 the
 process
 is
 nonstationary,
 however,
 it
 can
 be
 advantageous
to
 use
 a
 smaller
 value
 of
 m,
 or
 alternatively
 a
 weighted
 average
that
 decays
 as
 it
 goes
 into
 the
 past.
 How
 stationary
 is
 the
 process
generating
 technology
 costs,
 and
 what
 is
 the
 best
 choice
 of
 m?
We
 experimented
 with
 increasing
 m,
 as
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 9, and
compared
 this
 to
 the
 model
 with
 m =
 0.63.
 We  ﬁnd
 that
 the
 errors
drop
 as
 m
 increases
 roughly
 as
 one
 would
 expect
 if
 the
 process
were
 stationary23 and
 that
 the
 model
 does
 a
 reasonably
 good
 job
of
 forecasting
 the
 errors
 (see
 also
 Appendix
 C.1).
 This
 indicates
 that
the
 best
 choice
 is
 the
 largest
 possible
 value
 of
 m,
 which
 in
 this
 case
is
 m
 =
 16.
 However
 we
 should
 emphasize
 that
 it
 is
 entirely
 possible
that
 testing
 on
 a
 sample
 with
 longer
 time
 series
 might
 yield
 an
optimal
 value24 of
 m
 >
 16.
5.4.
 Is
 the
 model
 well-speciﬁed?
Because
 most
 of
 our
 time
 series
 are
 so
 short
 it
 is
 difﬁcult
 to
 say
whether
 or
 not
 the
 model
 is
 well-speciﬁed.
 As
 already
 noted,
 for
such
 short
 series
 it
 is
 impossible
 to
 usefully
 estimate
 technology-
speciﬁc
 values
 of
 the
 parameter
 ,
 which
 has
 forced
 us
 to
 use
 a
global
 value
 for
 all
 technologies.
 Averaging
 over
 the
 raw
 samples
suggests
 a
 relatively
 low
 value
 w =
 0.25,
 but
 a
 much
 higher
 value
23 Note
 that
 to
 check
 forecast
 errors
 for
 high
 m
 we  have
 used
 only
 technologies
for
 which
 at
 least
 m
 +
 2
 years
 were
 available.
 For
 large
 values
 of
 m
 the
 statistical
variation
 increases
 due
 to
 lack
 of
 data.
24 We present
 the
 results
 up
 to
 m
 =
 16
 because
 less
 than
 a
 third
 of
 the
 technologies
can
 be
 used
 with
 larger
 sample
 sizes.
 We  have
 performed
 the
 same
 analysis
 up
 to
m
 =
 35,
 where
 only
 5
 technologies
 are
 left,
 and
 the
 results
 remain
 qualitatively
 the
same.

 to

 (m

m =
 0.63
 is
 needed
 to
 match
 the
 empirically
 observed
 errors.
 How-
ever
 we
 should
 emphasize
 that
 with
 such
 short
 series
 
 is
 poorly
estimated,
 and
 it
 is
 not
 clear
 that
 averaging
 across
 different
 tech-
nologies
 is
 sufﬁcient
 to
 ﬁx
 this
 problem.
In
 our
 view
 it
 would
 be
 surprising
 if
 there
 are
 not
 technology-
speciﬁc
 variations
 in
 ;
 after
 all
 j and
 Kj vary
 signiﬁcantly
 across
technologies.
 So
 from
 this
 point
 of
 view
 it
 seems
 likely
 that
 the
model
 with
 a
 global
 
 is
 mis-speciﬁed.
 It
 is
 not
 clear
 whether
 this
would
 be
 true
 if
 we
 were
 able
 to
 measure
 technology-speciﬁc
 val-
ues
 of
 j. It
 is
 remarkable
 that
 such
 a
 simple
 model
 can
 represent
a
 complicated
 process
 such
 as
 technological
 improvement
 as
 well
as
 it
 does,
 and
 in
 any
 case,
 as
 we  have
 shown,
 using
 
 =
 m does
 a
good
 job
 of
 matching
 the
 empirically
 observed
 forecasting
 errors.
Nonetheless,
 testing
 with
 more
 data
 is
 clearly
 desirable.
6.
 Application
 to
 solar
 PV
 modules
In
 this
 section
 we
 provide
 a
 distributional
 forecast
 for
 the
 price
of
 solar
 photovoltaic
 modules.
 We  then
 show
 how
 this
 can
 be
 used
to
 make
 a
 comparison
 to
 a
 hypothetical
 competing
 technology
 in
order
 to
 estimate
 the
 probability
 that
 one
 technology
 will
 be
 less
expensive
 than
 another
 at
 a
 given
 time
 horizon.
6.1.
 A
 distributional
 forecast
 for
 solar
 energy
We have
 shown
 that
 the
 autocorrelated
 geometric
 random
 walk
can
 be
 used
 to
 forecast
 technological
 cost
 improvement
 and
 that
the
 formula
 we  have
 derived
 for
 the
 distribution
 of
 forecast
 errors
works
 well
 when
 applied
 to
 many
 different
 technologies.
 We now
demonstrate
 how
 this
 can
 be
 used
 to
 make
 a
 distributional
 fore-
cast
 for
 the
 cost
 improvement
 of
 a
 given
 technology.
 The
 fact
 that
the
 method
 has
 been
 extensively
 tested
 on
 many
 technologies
 in
the
 previous
 section
 gives
 us
 some
 conﬁdence
 that
 this
 forecast
 is
reliable.
We make
 the
 forecast
 using
 Eq.
 (16). We  use
 all
 available
 years
of
 past
 data
 (m
 =
 33)
 to
 ﬁt
 the
 parameters
 ˆS =
 ˜S =
 −0.10
 and
ˆKS = ˜KS =
 0.15,
 and
 we  used
 
 =
 m =
 0.63.
 The
 forecast
 is
 given
 by
Eq.
 (16)
 with
 appropriate
 substitutions
 of
 parameters,
 i.e.
yS(t
 +
 )∼N(yS(t)
 +
 ˜S, ˜K2
S A∗/(1

 The

 using
 Eq.
 (19)
 and
 the
 parameters
 discussed
in
 the
 text.

where
 A*(m)
 is
 deﬁned
 in
 Eq.
 (13). Fig.
 10
 shows
 the
 predicted
distribution
 of
 likely
 prices
 for
 solar
 photovoltaic
 modules
 for
 time
horizons
 up
 to
 2030.
 The
 intervals
 corresponding
 to
 plus
 or
 minus
two
 standard
 deviations
 in
 Fig.
 10
 are
 95%
 prediction
 intervals.
The
 prediction
 says
 that
 it
 is
 likely
 that
 solar
 PV
 modules
 will
continue
 to
 drop
 in
 cost
 at
 the
 roughly
 10%
 rate
 that
 they
 have
 in
the
 past.
 Nonetheless
 there
 is
 a
 small
 probability
 (about
 5%)
 that
 the
price
 in
 2030
 will
 be
 higher
 than
 it
 was
 in
 2013.25 While
 it
 might
seem
 remarkable
 to
 forecast
 15
 years
 ahead
 with
 only
 33
 years
 of
past
 data,
 note
 that
 throughout
 most
 of
 the
 paper
 we  were
 forecast-
ing
 up
 to
 20
 years
 ahead
 with
 only
 six
 years
 of
 data.
 As
 one
 uses
more
 past
 data,
 the
 width
 of
 the
 distributional
 forecast
 decreases.
In
 addition
 there
 are
 considerable
 variations
 in
 the
 standard
 devia-
tions ˜Kj of
 the
 technologies
 in
 Table
 1; these
 variations
 are
 reﬂected
in
 the
 width
 of
 the
 distribution
 at
 any
 given
 forecasting
 horizon.
 The
large
 deviation
 from
 the
 trend
 line
 that
 solar
 module
 costs
 made
 in
the
 early
 part
 of
 the
 millennium
 cause
 the
 estimated
 future
 variance
to
 be
 fairly
 large.
Except
 for
 the
 estimation
 of
 
 no
 data
 from
 other
 technologies
was
 used
 in
 this
 forecast.
 Nonetheless,
 data
 from
 other
 technologies
were
 key
 in
 giving
 us
 conﬁdence
 that
 the
 distributional
 forecast
 is
reliable.
6.2.
 Estimating
 the
 probability
 that
 one
 technology
 will
 be
 less
expensive
 than
 another
Suppose
 we
 want
 to
 compute
 the
 probability
 that
 a
 given
 tech-
nology
 will
 be
 less
 expensive
 than
 another
 competing
 technology
at
 a
 given
 point
 in
 the
 future.
 We  illustrate
 how
 this
 can
 be
 done
 by
comparing
 the
 log
 cost
 of
 photovoltaic
 modules
 yS with
 the
 log
 cost
of
 a
 hypothetical
 alternative
 technology
 yC. Both
 the
 cost
 of
 photo-
voltaic
 modules
 and
 technology
 C
 are
 assumed
 to
 follow
 Eq.
 (19),
but
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 argument
 we
 assume
 that,
 like
 coal,
 technology
 C
25 This
 forecast
 is
 consistent
 with
 the
 one
 made
 several
 years
 ago
 by
 Nagy
 et
 al.
(2013)
 using
 data
 only
 until
 2009.
 It
 is
 difﬁcult
 to
 compare
 this
 forecast
 with
 expert’s
elicitation
 studies,
 which
 are
 often
 more
 precise
 in
 terms
 of
 which
 PV
 technology
and
 which
 market
 is
 predicted
 and
 are
 often
 concerned
 with
 levelized
 costs.
 Indi-
vidual
 experts’
 distributional
 predictions
 for
 LCOE
 (see
 Fig.
 6
 in
 Bosetti
 et
 al.
 (2012))
seem
 tight
 as
 compared
 to
 ours
 (for
 modules
 only).
 However,
 the
 predictions
 for
the
 probability
 that
 PV
 will
 cost
 less
 than
 $0.30/Wp
 in
 2030
 reported
 in
 Fig.
 3
 of
Curtright
 et
 al.
 (2008)
 are
 overall
 comparable

 ours.

 We  also

 and
 that
 C =

We
 want
 to
 compute
 the

 that

 yS <

probability
 that
 yS <
 yC is
 the
 probability
 that
 the
 random

Z
 =

 positive.
 Since
 yS and

 assuming
 they

 their

In

 that
 the

 of
 the
 competing
 technol-
ogy
 is
 a
 third
 that
 of
 solar
 at
 the
 starting
 date
 in
 2013,
 and
 that
 it
 is
on
 average
 not
 dropping
 in
 cost,
 i.e.
 C =

 We  consider
 three
 dif-
ferent
 levels
 of
 the

 parameter ˜KC for
 technology
 C.
 Note
 that
changing
 the
 noise
 parameter
 does
 not
 change
 the
 expected
 time
when
 the
 curves
 cross.
The
 main
 point
 of
 this
 discussion
 is
 that
 with
 our
 method
 we
can
 reliably
 forecast
 the
 probability
 that
 a
 given
 technology
 will
surpass
 a
 competitor.
6.3.
 Discussion
 of
 PV
 relative
 to
 coal-ﬁred
 electricity
 and
 nuclear
power
In
 the
 above
 discussion
 we
 have
 carefully
 avoided
 discussing
 a
particular
 competing
 technology.
 A
 forecast
 for
 the
 full
 cost
 of
 solar
PV
 electricity
 requires
 predicting
 the
 balance
 of
 system
 costs,
 for
which
 we
 lack
 consistent
 historical
 data,
 and
 unlike
 module
 costs,
the
 full
 cost
 depends
 on
 factors
 such
 as
 insolation,
 interest
 rates
and
 local
 installation
 costs.
 As
 solar
 PV
 grows
 to
 be
 a
 signiﬁcant
portion
 of
 the
 energy
 supply
 the
 cost
 of
 storage
 will
 become
 very
important.
 Nonetheless,
 it
 is
 useful
 to
 discuss
 it
 in
 relation
 to
 the
two
 competitors
 mentioned
 in
 the
 introduction.
J.D.
 Farmer,
 F.
 Lafond
 / Research
 Policy
 45
 (2016)
 647–665
 
659
An
 analysis
 of
 coal-ﬁred
 electricity,
 breaking
 down
 costs
 into
their
 components
 and
 examining
 each
 of
 the
 trends
 separately,
has
 been
 made
 by
 McNerney
 et
 al.
 (2011). They
 show
 that
 while
coal
 plant
 costs
 (which
 are
 currently
 roughly
 40%
 of
 total
 cost)
dropped
 historically,
 this
 trend
 reversed
 circa
 1980.
 Even
 if
 the
recent
 trend
 reverses
 and
 plant
 construction
 cost
 drops
 dramati-
cally
 in
 the
 future,
 the
 cost
 of
 coal
 is
 likely
 to
 eventually
 dominate
the
 total
 cost
 of
 coal-ﬁred
 electricity.
 As
 mentioned
 before,
 this
is
 because
 the
 historical
 cost
 of
 coal
 is
 consistent
 with
 a
 random
walk
 without
 drift,
 and
 currently
 fuel
 is
 about
 40%
 of
 total
 costs.
 If
coal
 remains
 constant
 in
 cost
 (except
 for
 random
 ﬂuctuations
 up
or
 down)
 then
 this
 places
 a
 hard
 bound
 on
 how
 much
 the
 total
cost
 of
 coal-ﬁred
 electricity
 can
 decrease.
 Since
 typical
 plants
 have
efﬁciencies
 the
 order
 of
 1/3
 there
 is
 not
 much
 room
 for
 making
the
 burning
 of
 coal
 more
 efﬁcient
 –
 even
 a
 spectacular
 efﬁciency
improvement
 to
 2/3
 of
 the
 theoretical
 limit
 is
 only
 an
 improve-
ment
 of
 a
 factor
 of
 two,
 corresponding
 to
 the
 average
 progress
 PV
modules
 make
 in
 about
 7.5
 years.
 Similar
 arguments
 apply
 to
 oil
and
 natural
 gas.26
Because
 historical
 nuclear
 power
 costs
 have
 tended
 to
 increase,
not
 just
 in
 the
 US
 but
 worldwide,
 even
 a
 forecast
 that
 they
will
 remain
 constant
 seems
 optimistic.
 Levelized
 costs
 for
 solar
PV
 powerplants
 in
 2013
 were
 as
 low
 as
 0.078–0.142
 Euro/kWh
(0.09–0.16$)
 in
 Germany
 (Kost
 et
 al.,
 2013),27 and
 in
 2014
 solar
PV
 reached
 a
 new
 record
 low
 with
 an
 accepted
 bid
 of
 $0.06/kWh
for
 a
 plant
 in
 Dubai.28 When
 these
 are
 compared
 to
 the
 projected
cost
 of
 $0.14/kWh
 in
 2023
 for
 the
 Hinkley
 Point
 nuclear
 reactor,
 it
appears
 that
 the
 two
 technologies
 already
 have
 roughly
 equal
 costs,
though
 of
 course
 a
 direct
 comparison
 is
 difﬁcult
 due
 to
 factors
 such
as
 intermittency,
 waste
 disposal,
 insurance
 costs,
 etc.
As
 a
 ﬁnal
 note,
 skeptics
 have
 claimed
 that
 solar
 PV
 cannot
 be
ramped
 up
 quickly
 enough
 to
 play
 a
 signiﬁcant
 role
 in
 combatting
global
 warming.
 A
 simple
 trend
 extrapolation
 of
 the
 growth
 of
 solar
energy
 (PV
 and
 solar
 thermal)
 suggests
 that
 it
 could
 represent
 20%
of
 the
 energy
 consumption
 by
 2027.
 In
 contrast
 the
 “hi-Ren”
 (high
renewable)
 scenario
 of
 the
 International
 Energy
 Agency,
 which
 is
presumably
 based
 on
 expert
 analysis,
 assumes
 that
 PV
 will
 generate
16%
 of
 total
 electricity
 in
 2050.
 Thus
 even
 in
 their
 optimistic
 forecast
they
 assume
 PV
 will
 take
 25
 years
 longer
 than
 the
 historical
 trend
suggests
 (to
 hit
 a
 lower
 target).
 We  hope
 in
 the
 future
 to
 formulate

 Conclusion
Many
 technologies
 follow
 a
 similar
 pattern
 of
 progress
 but
with
 very
 different
 rates.
 In
 this
 paper
 we
 have
 proposed
 a
 sim-
ple
 method
 based
 on
 the
 autocorrelated
 geometric
 random
 walk
to
 provide
 robust
 predictions
 for
 technological
 progress
 that
 are
stated
 as
 distributions
 of
 outcomes
 rather
 than
 point
 forecasts.
 We
assume
 that
 all
 technologies
 follow
 a
 similar
 process
 except
 for
their
 rates
 of
 improvement
 and
 volatility.
 Under
 this
 assumption
26 Though
 much
 has
 been
 made
 of
 the
 recent
 drop
 in
 the
 price
 of
 natural
 gas
 due
to
 fracking,
 which
 has
 had
 a
 large
 effect,
 one
 should
 bear
 in
 mind
 that
 the
 drop
is
 tiny
 in
 comparison
 to
 the
 factor
 of
 about
 2330
 by
 which
 solar
 PV
 modules
 have
dropped
 in
 price.
 The
 small
 change
 induced
 by
 fracking
 is
 only
 important
 because
it
 is
 competing
 in
 a narrow
 price
 range
 with
 other
 fossil
 fuel
 technologies.
 In
 work
with
 other
 collaborators
 we
 have
 examined
 not
 just
 oil,
 coal
 and
 gas,
 but
 more
 than
a
 hundred
 minerals;
 all
 of
 them
 show
 remarkably
 ﬂat
 historical
 prices,
 i.e.
 they
 all
change
 by
 less
 than
 an
 order
 of
 magnitude
 over
 the
 course
 of
 a century.
27 Levelized
 costs
 decrease
 more
 slowly
 than
 module
 costs,
 but
 do
 decrease
(Nemet,
 2006).
 For
 instance,
 installation
 costs
 per
 watt
 have
 fallen
 in
 Germany
 and
are
 now
 about
 half
 what
 they
 are
 in
 the
 U.S.
 (Barbose
 et
 al.,
 2014).
28 See

utility-dewa-procures-the-worlds-cheapest-solar-energy-ever
we
 can
 pool
 forecast
 errors
 of
 different
 technologies
 to
 obtain
 an
empirical
 estimation
 of
 the
 distribution
 of
 forecast
 errors.
One
 of
 the
 essential
 points
 of
 this
 paper
 is
 that
 the
 use
 of
 many
technologies
 allows
 us
 to
 make
 a
 better
 forecast
 for
 a
 given
 technol-
ogy,
 such
 as
 solar
 PV
 modules.
 Although
 using
 many
 technologies
does
 not
 affect
 our
 point
 forecast,
 it
 is
 the
 essential
 element
 that
allowed
 us
 to
 test
 our
 distributional
 forecasts
 in
 order
 to
 ensure
that
 they
 are
 reliable.
 The
 point
 is
 that
 by
 treating
 all
 technologies
as
 essentially
 the
 same
 except
 for
 their
 parameters,
 and
 collapsing
all
 the
 data
 onto
 a
 single
 distribution,
 we
 can
 pool
 data
 from
 many
technologies
 to
 gain
 conﬁdence
 in
 and
 calibrate
 our
 method
 for
 a
given
 technology.
 It
 is
 of
 course
 a
 bold
 assumption
 to
 say
 that
 all
technologies
 follow
 a
 random
 process
 with
 the
 same
 form,
 but
 the
empirical
 results
 indicate
 that
 this
 a
 good
 hypothesis.
We do
 not
 want
 to
 suggest
 in
 this
 paper
 that
 we
 think
 that
Moore’s
 law
 provides
 an
 optimal
 forecasting
 method.
 Quite
 the
contrary,
 we  believe
 that
 by
 gathering
 more
 historical
 data,
 and
by
 adding
 other
 auxiliary
 variables
 such
 as
 production,
 R&D,
 patent
activity,
 there
 should
 be
 considerable
 room
 for
 improving
 forecast-
ing
 power.
 In
 the
 future
 we
 anticipate
 that
 theories
 will
 eventually
provide
 causal
 explanations
 for
 why
 technologies
 improve
 at
 such
different
 rates
 and
 this
 will
 result
 in
 better
 forecasts.
 Nonetheless,
in
 the
 meantime
 the
 method
 we
 have
 introduced
 here
 provides
a
 benchmark
 against
 which
 other
 approaches
 can
 be
 measured.
It provides
 a
 proof
 of
 principle
 that
 technologies
 can
 be
 success-
fully
 forecast
 and
 that
 the
 errors
 in
 the
 forecasts
 can
 be
 reliably
predicted.
From
 a
 policy
 perspective
 we  believe
 that
 our
 method
 can
be
 used
 to
 provide
 an
 objective
 point
 of
 comparison
 to
 expert
forecasts,
 which
 are
 often
 biased
 by
 vested
 interests
 and
 other
factors.
 The
 fact
 that
 we
 can
 associate
 uncertainties
 with
 our
 pre-
dictions
 makes
 them
 far
 more
 useful
 than
 simple
 point
 forecasts.
The
 example
 of
 solar
 PV
 modules
 illustrates
 that
 differences
 in
the
 improvement
 rate
 of
 competing
 technologies
 can
 be
 dramatic,
and
 that
 an
 underdog
 can
 begin
 far
 behind
 the
 pack
 and
 quickly
emerge
 as
 a
 front-runner.
 Given
 the
 urgency
 of
 limiting
 green-
house
 gas
 emissions,
 it
 is
 fortuitous
 that
 a
 green
 technology
 also
happens
 to
 have
 such
 a
 rapid
 improvement
 rate,
 and
 is
 likely
 to
eventually
 surpass
 its
 competition
 within
 10
 −
 20
 years.
 In
 a
 con-
text
 where
 limited
 resources
 for
 technology
 investment
 constrain
policy
 makers
 to
 focus
 on
 a
 few
 technologies
 that
 have
 a
 real
 chance
to
 eventually
 achieve
 and
 even
 exceed
 grid
 parity,
 the
 ability
 to
have
 improved
 forecasts
 and
 know
 how
 accurate
 they
 are
 should
prove
 particularly
 useful.

 Distribution
 of
 forecast
 errors
B.1.
 Random
 walk
 with
 drift
This
 section
 derives
 the
 distribution
 of
 forecast
 errors.
 Note
 that
by
 deﬁnition
 yt+1 −
 yt =
 y∼N(,
 K2).
 To
 obtain
 ˆ
 we
 assume
 m
sequential
 independent
 observations
 of
 y, and
 compute
 the
 aver-
age.
 The
 sampling
 distribution
 of
 the
 mean
 of
 a
 normal
 variable
is
ˆ∼N(,
 K2/m).
 
(21)
Moreover,
 nt∼N(0, K2)
 implies
t+

i=t+1
ni∼N(0,
 K2).
 
(22)
Using
 Eqs.
 (21)
 and
 (22)
 in
 Eq.
 (7)
 we
 see
 that
 the
 distribution
 of
forecast
 errors
 is
 Gaussian
E
 =
 (
 −
 ˆ) +
t+

i=t+1
ni∼N(0,  K2A),
 
(23)
where
 A
 =
 
 +
 2/m
 (10). Eq.
 (23)
 implies
1
√
A
E
K ∼N(0,
 1).
(24)
Eq.
 (23)
 leads
 to
 E[E2]
 =
 K2(
 +
 2/m),
 which
 appears
 in
 more
 gen-
eral
 form
 in
 Sampson
 (1991). However
 we
 also
 have
 to
 account
 for
the
 fact
 that
 we
 have
 to
 estimate
 the
 variance.
 Since ˆK2 is
 the
 sample
variance
 of
 a
 normally
 distributed
 random
 variable,
 the
 following
standard
 result
 holds
(m
 −
 1) ˆK2
K2
∼	2(m
 −
 1).
 
(25)
If
 Z∼N(0,
 1),
 U
 ∼
 	2(r),
 and
 Z
 and
 U
 are
 independent,
 then
Z/
	
U/r∼t(r).
 Taking
 Z
 from
 Eq.
 (24), U
 from
 Eq.
 (25)
 and
 assuming
independence,
 we
 ﬁnd
 that
 the
 rescaled
 normalized
 forecast
 errors
have
 a
 Student
 t
 distribution
1
√
A
E
ˆK
∼t(m

(26)
Note
 that
 the
 t
 distribution
 has
 mean
 0
 but
 variance
 df/(df
 −
 2),
where
 df
 are
 the
 degrees
 of
 freedom.
 Hence
 the
 expected

 The

 m

forecasts
 are
 made
 as
 if
 the
 process
 was
 a
 random
 walk
 with
 drift.
First
 note
 that,
 from
 Eq.
 (11),
yt+ =
 yt +
 
 +
t+

i=t+1
[vi +
 vi−1].
Using
 Eq.
 (5)
 to
 make
 the
 prediction
 implies
 that
E
 =
 yt+ −ˆyt+ =
 (
 −
 ˆ) +
t+

i=t+1
[vi +
 vi−1].
Now
 we
 can
 substitute
ˆ

m
t−1

i=t−m
(yi+1 −
 yi)
 =
 
 + 1
m
t−1

t−1

i=t−m
[vi+1 +
 vi]

+
t+

i=t+1
[vi +
 vi−1].
Expanding
 the
 two
 sums,
 this
 can
 be
 rewritten
E
 =
−
m vt−m −(1

 )
m
t−1

i=t−m+1
vi

 −
m

vt +
 (1

 )
t+−1

i=t+1
vi +
 vt+.
Note
 that
 the
 term
 vt enters
 in
 the
 forecast
 error
 both
 because
it
 has
 an
 effect
 on
 parameter
 estimation
 and
 because
 of
 its
 effect
on
 future
 noise.
 Now
 that
 we  have
 separated
 the
 terms
 we
 are
 left
with
 a
 sum
 of
 independent
 normal
 random
 variables.
 Hence
 we
 can
obtain
 E∼N(0, 2A∗),

 Size
 of
 the

As
 a
 check
 on
 the
 results
 presented
 in
 Section
 5.3
 we  test
 the
dependence
 of
 the
 forecast
 errors
 on
 the
 sample
 window
 m
 for
 sev-
eral
 different
 forecast
 horizons.
 The
 results
 are
 robust
 to
 a
 change
of
 the
 size
 of
 learning
 window
 m.
 It
 is
 not
 possible
 to
 go
 below
 m
 =
 4
because
 when
 m
 =
 3
 the
 Student
 distribution
 has
 m
 −

 degrees
of
 freedom,
 hence
 an
 inﬁnite
 variance.
 Note
 that
 to
 make
 forecasts
using
 a
 large
 m
 only
 the
 datasets
 which
 are
 long
 enough
 can
 be
included.
 The
 results
 for
 a
 few
 values
 of
 m
 are
 shown
 in
 Fig.

Fig.

 shows
 that
 the
 normalized
 mean
 squared

 error
consistently
 decreases
 as
 the
 learning
 window
 increases.
C.2.
 Data

We
 have
 checked
 how
 the
 results
 change
 when
 about
 half
 of
 the
technologies
 are
 randomly
 selected
 and
 removed
 from
 the
 dataset.
The
 shape
 of
 the
 normalized
 mean
 squared

 growth
does
 not
 change
 and
 is
 shown
 in
 Fig.

 procedure
 is
 based
 on
10000
 random
 trials
 selecting
 half
 the
 technologies.
C.3.
 Increasing
 max
In
 the
 main
 text
 we
 have
 shown
 the
 results
 for
 a
 forecast
 horizon
up
 to
 max =
 20.
 Moreover,
 we
 have
 used
 only
 the
 forecast
 errors
 up
to
 max to
 construct
 the
 empirical
 distribution
 of
 forecast
 errors
 in
Fig.
 8
 and
 to
 estimate
 
 in
 Appendix
 D. Fig.
 15
 shows
 that
 if
 we  use
all
 the
 forecast
 errors
 up
 to
 the
 maximum
 with
 
 =
 73
 the
 results
 do
not
 change
 signiﬁcantly.
C.4.
 Heavy
 tail
 innovations
To
 check
 the
 effect
 of
 non-normal
 noise
 increments
 on
 ()
 we
simulated
 random
 walks
 with
 drift
 with
 noise
 increments
 drawn
from
 a
 Student
 distribution
 with
 3
 or
 7
 degrees
 of
 freedom.
 Fig.
 16
shows
 that
 fat
 tail
 noise
 increments
 do
 not
 change
 the
 long
 horizon
errors
 very
 much.
 While
 the
 IMA(1,1)
 model
 produces
 a
 parallel
shift
 of
 the
 errors
 at
 medium
 to
 long
 horizons,
 the
 Student
 noise
increments
 generate
 larger
 errors
 mostly
 at
 short

 Procedure
 for

 ways.
 The

 is
 to

 of

 for
 the ˜j estimated
 on

The
 main
 problem
 with

 Comparison
 of

In

 we
 check
 whether
 the

 of
 the

 from
 the
 predicted
 theoretical
 distribution
 shown
in
 Fig.

 are
 consistent
 with
 statistical

 For
 a
 given
value
 of
 
 we
 generate
 a
 surrogate
 data
 set
 and
 surrogate
 forecasts
mimicking
 our
 empirical
 data
 as
 described
 at
 the
 end
 of
 Section
4.1. We  then
 construct
 a
 sample
 surrogate
 (cumulative)
 distribu-
tion
 Pk for
 the
 pooled
 rescaled
 errors
 * of
 Eq.
 (15). We  measure
 the
distribution
 Pk over
 1,000
 equally
 spaced
 values
 xk on
 the
 interval
[−
 15
 ; 15].
 Pk is
 estimated
 by
 simply
 counting
 the
 number
 of
 obser-
vations
 less
 than
 xk. This
 is
 then
 compared
 to
 the
 predicted
 Student
distribution
 tk by
 computing
 the
 difference
 k =
 Pk −
 tk between
 the
surrogate
 distribution
 and
 the
 Student
 distribution
 in
 each
 inter-
val.
 We  measure
 the
 overall
 deviation
 between
 the
 surrogate
 and
the
 Student
 using
 three
 different
 measures
 of
 deviation: 
k|k|,

k(k)2, and
 max
 k. We  then
 repeat
 this
 process
 10,000
 times
 to
generate
 a
 histogram
 for
 each
 of
 the
 measures
 above,
 and
 compare
this
 to
 the
 measured
 value
 of
 the
 deviation
 for
 the
 real
 data.
Results
 for
 doing
 this
 for
 w =
 0.25
 and
 m =
 0.63
 are
 reported
 in
Fig.
 19. For
 w the
 resulting
 p-values
 (the
 shares
 of
 random
 datasets
with
 a
 deviation
 higher
 than
 the
 empirical
 deviation)
 are
 (0.001,
0.002,
 0.011)
 respectively
 using
 (
k|k|, 
k(k)2, max
 k) to
measure
 the
 deviation.
 In
 contrast
 for
 m =
 0.63
 the
 p-values
 are
(0.21,
 0.16,
 0.20).
 Thus
 m =
 0.63
 is
 accepted
 and
 w =
 0.25
 is
rejected.
 The
 uncorrelated
 case
 
 =
 0
 is
 rejected
 even
 more
 strongly.

 A
 trend
 extrapolation
 of
 solar
 energy
 capacity
In
 this
 paper
 we
 have
 been
 concerned
 with
 forecasting
 costs.
For
 some
 applications
 it
 is
 also
 useful
 to
 forecast
 production.
Our
 exploratory
 work
 so
 far
 suggests
 that,
 while
 the
 same
 basic
methods
 can
 be
 applied,
 production
 seems
 more
 likely
 to
 deviate
systematically
 from
 increasing
 exponentially.
 Nonetheless,
 Nagy
et
 al.
 (2013)
 found
 that
 as
 a
 rough
 approximation
 most
 of
 the
 tech-
nologies
 in
 our
 data
 set
 can
 be
 crudely
 (but
 usefully)
 approximated
as
 having
 exponentially
 increasing
 production
 for
 a
 long
 span
 of
their
 development
 cycle,
 and
 solar
 PV
 is
 no
 exception.
 Trend
 extrap-
olation
 can
 add
 perspective,
 even
 if
 it
 comes
 without
 good
 error
estimates,
 and
 the
 example
 we
 present
 below
 motivates
 the
 need
for
 more
 work
 to
 formulate
 better
 methods
 for
 assessing
 the
 reli-
ability
 of
 production
 forecasts
 (for
 an
 example,
 see
 Shlyakhter
 et
 al.
(1994)).
Many
 analysts
 have
 expressed
 concerns
 about
 the
 time
 required
to
 build
 the
 needed
 capacity
 for
 solar
 energy
 to
 play
 a
 role
 in
reducing
 greenhouse
 gas
 emissions.
 The
 “hi-Ren”
 (high
 renew-
able)
 scenario
 of
 the
 International
 Energy
 Agency
 assumes
 that
 PV
will
 generate
 16%
 of
 total
 electricity29 in
 2050;
 this
 was
 recently
increased
 from
 the
 previous
 estimate
 of
 only
 11%.
 As
 a
 point
 of
comparison,
 what
 do
 past
 trends
 suggest?
 Though
 estimates
 vary,
over
 the
 last
 ten
 years
 cumulative
 installed
 capacity
 of
 PV
 has
grown
 at
 an
 impressive
 rate.
 According
 to
 BP’s
 Statistical
 Review
of
 World
 Energy
 2014,
 during
 the
 period
 from
 1983-2013
 solar
energy
 as
 a
 whole
 grew
 at
 an
 annual
 rate
 of
 42.5%
 and
 in
 2013
represented
 about
 0.22%
 of
 total
 primary
 energy
 consumption,
 as
shown
 in
 Fig.
 20. By
 comparison
 total
 primary
 energy
 consump-
tion
 grew
 at
 an
 annual
 rate
 of
 2.6%
 over
 the
 period
 1965-2013.
Given
 that
 solar
 energy
 is
 an
 intermittent
 source,
 it
 is
 much
 eas-
ier
 for
 it
 to
 contribute
 when
 it
 supplies
 only
 a
 minority
 of
 energy:
new
 supporting
 technologies
 will
 be
 required
 once
 it
 becomes
a
 major
 player.
 If
 we  somewhat
 arbitrarily
 pick
 20%
 as
 a
 target,
assuming
 both
 these
 trends
 continue
 unaltered,
 a
 simple
 calcula-
tion
 shows
 that
 this
 would
 be
 achieved
 in
 about
 13.7
 years.30 That
is,
 under
 these
 assumptions
 in
 2027
 solar
 would
 represent
 20%
 of
energy
 consumption.
 Of
 course
 this
 is
 only
 an
 extrapolation,
 but
it
 puts
 into
 perspective
 claims
 that
 solar
 energy
 cannot
 play
 an
essential
 role
 in
 mitigating
 global
 warming
 on
 a
 relatively
 short
timescale.
Of
 course
 the
 usual
 caveats
 apply,
 and
 the
 limitations
 of
 such
forecasting
 is
 evident
 in
 the
 historical
 series
 of
 Fig.
 20. The
 increase
29 Electricity
 generation
 uses
 about
 40%
 of
 the
 world’s
 primary
 energy
 but
 is
expected
 to
 grow
 signiﬁcantly.
30 In
 this
 deterministic
 setting,
 the
 time
 to
 meet
 this
 goal
 is
 the
 solution
 for
 t of
0.0022(1.425)t =
 0.2(1.026)t.

of
 solar
 is
 far
 from
 smooth,
 wind
 has
 a
 rather
 dramatic
 break
 in
its
 slope
 in
 roughly
 1988,
 and
 a
 forecast
 for
 nuclear
 power
 made
in
 1980
 based
 on
 production
 alone
 would
 have
 been
 far
 more
optimistic
 than
 one
 today.
 It
 would
 be
 interesting
 to
 use
 a
 richer
economic
 model
 to
 forecast
 cost
 and
 production
 simultaneously,
but
 this
 is
 beyond
 the
 scope
 of
 this
 paper.
 The
 point
 here
 was
 sim-
ply
 to
 show
 that
 if
 growth
 trends
 continue
 as
 they
 have
 in
 the
 past
signiﬁcant
 contributions
 by
 solar
 are
 achievable.

 1. Introduction 
 Harvesting 
sunlight 
with 
photovoltaic 
(PV) cells could generate enough electrical 
energy to meet the world’s increasing energy 
demand while simultaneously enabling 
a reduction in the environmental impact 
associated with present modes of electricity 
production. [ 1 ]  Scaling of PV installations 
to the needed terawatt scale, however, will 
require signiﬁ cant improvements in the 
cost-effectiveness of installed PVs, including 
improvements in their power conversion 
efﬁ ciencies (PCE) as well as reductions in 
the cost of PV module installation through 
streamlined fabrication and innovations in 
rapid and lightweight PV deployment. 
 Advancements in the ﬁ eld of nano-
structured PVs (nano-PVs) have led to 
rapid improvements over the past decade 
in the power conversion efﬁ ciencies of this 
broad class of solar cells, [ 2 ] in which we 
include molecular, organic, polymeric, dye-
sensitized, and colloidal quantum dot 
(CQD) PVs due to the similarity of the 
physical processes that govern their operation and fabrication. In 
general, we deﬁ ne nano-PVs as solar cells that 1) consist of thin 
ﬁ lms ( < 2  μ m) of semiconductor material, 2) incorporate nanom-
eter-scale optoelectronic materials that 3) have excitonic or 
quantum-conﬁ nement character and 4) can be fabricated entirely 
with low-temperature ( < 300  ° C) processing steps. The compat-
ibility of many nanostructured PV materials with the use of low-
temperature processing can enable the use of ﬂ exible, lightweight 
substrates, [ 3 , 4 ] potentially leading to a lower cost of solar module 
fabrication and installation. A particular advantage of nanostruc-
tured materials is the tunability of their optical and electronic 
properties, which may enable the implementation of “third-
generation” approaches (i.e., strategies for reducing thermal 
losses) for improved PV power conversion efﬁ ciencies. [ 5 ]  
 Here, we ﬁ rst review the fundamental limits to the perform-
ance of solar cells and then consider those limits in the con-
text of various nano-PV technologies that are currently under 
investigation. We review the state of the art for PV technologies 
in each material class and calculate practical and semiempirical 
limits to their efﬁ ciency, taking into account the prospect for 
the application of third-generation concepts such as multiple 
exciton generation (MEG), singlet ﬁ ssion, and stacked-tandem 
 The signiﬁ cant research interest in the engineering of photovoltaic (PV) 
structures at the nanoscale is directed toward enabling reductions in PV 
module fabrication and installation costs as well as improving cell 
power conversion efﬁ ciency (PCE). With the emergence of a multitude 
of nanostructured photovoltaic (nano-PV) device architectures, the 
question has arisen of where both the practical and the fundamental 
limits of performance reside in these new systems. Here, the former 
is addressed a posteriori. The speciﬁ c challenges associated with 
improving the electrical power conversion efﬁ ciency of various nano-PV 
technologies are discussed and several approaches to reduce their 
thermal losses beyond the single bandgap limit are reviewed. Critical 
considerations related to the module lifetime and cost that are unique 
to nano-PV architectures are also addressed. The analysis suggests that a 
practical single-junction laboratory power conversion efﬁ ciency limit of 
17% and a two-cell tandem power conversion efﬁ ciency limit of 24% are 
possible for nano-PVs, which, when combined with operating lifetimes of 
10 to 15 years, could position them as a transformational technology for 
solar energy markets.

where  J M V M is the maximum power operating point on the  J – V 
curve and the resistance term is neglected in the SQ limit. 
 3. Practical Demonstrations of Nano-PVs 
Operation 
 We now consider how the operating parameters for a broad 
range of reported nano-PV structures compare with these theo-
retical limits.  Figure  1 and  2 are plots of  J SC ,  V OC , and  η P as 
a function of the optical gap. [ 12 ] This data is also tabulated in 
 Table  1 .While not exhaustive, this list provides a representative 
range of efﬁ ciencies for each nano-PV type, including the pres-
ently highest-reported and certiﬁ ed values. 
 Five decades since Shockley and Queisser derived the power 
conversion efﬁ ciency limit of single-junction photovoltaic cells, 
researchers have still not demonstrated such high performance 
for any photovoltaic device system. [ 10 ] For example, the power 
conversion efﬁ ciency of the best single-crystal-Si single-junction 
PVs is   η P  = 25% (without solar concentration), [ 2 , 10 ] which is only 
device architectures. We also address critical considerations 
related to cost and module lifetime that are unique to nanos-
tructured PV architectures. 
 2. Theoretical Limits of PV Operation 
 Single-junction photovoltaic cells are typically limited by four 
fundamental loss mechanisms: [ 6 , 7 ] 1) incomplete solar spec-
trum absorption, 2) thermalization of hot carriers (or excitons) 
in the form of excess heat, 3) chemical potential (thermody-
namic) losses dictating that the photovoltage must be less than 
band gap ( E G ) for relaxed carriers, and 4) radiative recombina-
tion. The presence of other non-radiative losses (e.g., Auger 
recombination, [ 8 ] internal or phonon conversion, surface 
recombination, [ 8 , 9 ] etc.) can further reduce cell performance. [ 10 ] 
Considering only radiative losses, Shockley and Queisser (SQ) 
predicted a limiting power efﬁ ciency of 30% under simulated 
black body radiation, [ 7 ] that has been subsequently recalculated 
as 33% under AM 1.5 solar irradiance. [ 6 , 10 ] 
 The power conversion efﬁ ciency (PCE) is deﬁ ned as

1.5G illumination follow the curve for the practical photocurrent limit (M1) deﬁ ned by 75%  EQE across the spectrum to  E G . M2 MEG is a two-staircase

best technical demonstrations. Our literature 
survey of nano-PV technologies (Table  1 ) col-
lects device data of the best experimentally 
reported performance in terms of  EQE ,  FF , 
and  V OC over the last two decades. From this 
data a semiempirical estimate for the practical 
upper limit to the power conversion efﬁ ciency 
of nano-PVs is derived. For example, the max-
imum demonstrated  EQE  across the spectrum 
is  ≈ 75% with internal quantum efﬁ ciencies 
approaching 100% (Table  1 ); the losses in  EQE 
are due primarily to combined optical losses 
( ≈ 10% loss from the transparent conduc-
tive oxide electrode absorption,  ≈ 5% reﬂ ec-
tion from the front facet of the substrate, and 
 ≈ 10% loss from internal reﬂ ections), which 
likely will be difﬁ cult to eliminate in a prac-
tical device structure. Assuming this average 
maximum  EQE of 75% is maintained at wavelengths extending 
to the band edge of the optically active semiconductor of the PV 
cell, upper limits of  J SC are calculated as a function of optical 
bandgap (labeled “M1”) according to  Equation 3 . For estimates of 
76% of the SQ limit. Hence, in evaluating the achievable per-
formance of a comparatively new PV technology, such as nano-
PVs, it is prudent and necessary to make an estimate of the upper 
limit of the achievable   η P by numerically evaluating trends of the

PROGRESS REPORT
the best practical device performance, upper 
limits for the  FF as a function of optical gap 
are similarly assumed to be that of the highest 
reported (i.e.,  FF  = 0.75) across the spectrum 
(Table  1 ). Deviations in  FF from the SQ limit 
generally stem from a combination of large 
series resistance ( R S ) and low shunt resist-
ance ( R P ). While many empirical forms have 
been proposed for the dependence of  V OC as a 
function of  E G , [ 13 , 14 ]  it is found that maximum 
demonstrated photovoltages follow a trend 
of reaching 80% of the value predicted by 
the SQ limit ( Equation 4 ); the difference can 
be attributed to a number of recombination 
phenomena including internal conversion, 
interface recombination, and exciton binding 
losses, as discussed below. [ 15 ] Nonetheless, 
this threshold in  V OC is consistent with the 
framework of the SQ limit and can be used in 
combination with the practical upper limits in 
photocurrents and ﬁ ll-factors to estimate the 
ultimate laboratory efﬁ ciency limits of nano-
PVs, as shown in Figure  2 a. We ﬁ nd that a 
semiempirically derived maximum efﬁ ciency 
of 17% is achievable for a single-junction cell 
with a bandgap in the range of 1.1 eV to 1.4 eV. 
This maximum efﬁ ciency is lower than that 
reported in recent semitheoretical studies in 
which practical considerations described above 
are not taken into account and which led to 
maximum exciton-limited efﬁ ciencies ranging 
from 22–27%. [ 15 ]  Also plotted in Figure  2 a are 
 η P versus. bandgap curves calculated with 
 Equation 3 – 5 based on the implementation of 
various third-generation concepts (shown in 
 Figure  3 ) that will be described in detail below; 
for two-cell current-matched nanostructured 
tandems, the optimal efﬁ ciency as function of 
top-cell bandgap is shown in Figure  2 a, where 
the corresponding optimal pairing of the back-
cell gap is plotted in Figure  2 b.  
 4. Analysis of Performance 
of Nano-PV Technologies 
 In the remainder of this article, we review the challenges asso-
ciated with each type of nano-PV device and suggest particular 
areas for improvement in order to approach the efﬁ ciency limits. 
We then discuss third-generation concepts particularly relevant to 
nanostructured materials that can allow for efﬁ ciencies beyond the 
single-junction limit and, ﬁ nally, consider these efﬁ ciency limits 
in the context of the nano-PV module cost and operating lifetime. 
 4.1. Small Molecule and Polymer PVs 
 One of the distinguishing features of molecular, organic, and 
polymeric semiconductors is the presence of strongly bound 
excited states, known as Frenkel excitons. [ 16 ] These excitons 
have a signiﬁ cant impact on many of the processes in photo-
voltaic devices, from photocurrent generation to the character-
istically pronounced absorption features. [ 3 ] For example, organic 
semiconductors typically exhibit static dielectric constants in the 
range of 2 to 5 [ 16 ] and, accordingly, exhibit large exciton binding 
energies of between 0.2 eV and 0.8 eV. 
 To overcome this exciton binding energy, bilayer donor–
acceptor architectures have become common to promote 
exciton separation to free carriers [ 17–19 ] as shown in  Figure  4 . 
However, there still remains an inherent tradeoff between the 
light absorption efﬁ ciency within the nano-PV device layers 
(quantiﬁ ed by the absorption constant,   α ) and exciton diffu-
sion efﬁ ciency (quantiﬁ ed by the exciton diffusion length, 
 Figure  3 .  a) Schematic of various methods relevant in nanostructured materials to reduce 
thermal losses including singlet exciton ﬁ ssion, multiple exciton generation, and tandem 
stacking. E G,Jsc (singlet level) and E G,Voc (triplet level) are the gaps used to calculate the  J sc and 
 V OC in the SQ limit, respectively, for singlet ﬁ ssion case SF1, where there is negligable oscil-
lator strength between the triplet and singlet levels for photocurrent generation. Solid arrows 
are optical transition, red dashed arrows are electronics transistions associated with multiple 
exciton generation and the blue dashed line designates charge transfer exciton dissociation. 
b) AM 1.5G solar photon ﬂ ux as a function of energy and the representative external quantum 
efﬁ ciency proﬁ les of various cell conﬁ gurations. Proﬁ les are offset slightly from the M1 (prac-
tical) line for clarity; M2 and M3 MEG are a two-staircase and three staircase multiplication 
proﬁ le, respectively; SF1 is a lone singlet ﬁ ssion material (or paired with an acceptor bandgap 
larger than the triplet level) and SF2 is a singlet-ﬁ ssion material paired with acceptor that has an 
optical gap equal to the triplet level of the SF material; T is the 2-cell current-matched tandem 
scenario where the vertical lines indicate the two bandgaps.

the charge-transfer or dissociation efﬁ ciency, and   η CC is the 
charge collection efﬁ ciency. In the absence of optical interfer-
ence,  ηA = T(1 −exp(−αd)) where  T is the total transmission 
through the substrate and the transparent conductive oxide 
electrode to the active layer (typically limited to at most 75%),   α 
is the absorption coefﬁ cient, and  d is the active layer thickness; 
 ηED = exp(−d/L D) ;  ηCT ≈1 for a large donor–acceptor energy 
offset that drives efﬁ cient exciton dissociation at the bilayer 
interface;  ηCC = L C/d(1 −exp(−d/L C)) , where  L C is the charge 
collection length. [ 20 , 21 ] This model for the  EQE is plotted in 
 Figure  5 as a function of   α d for various values of   α L D and   α L C . 
Typical values for  α L D are ≤ 1 so that for planar PV structures, 
exciton diffusion is the limiting process. [ 3 ]  
 Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structures aim to decouple these 
two limiting efﬁ ciencies through the use of interpenetrating net-
works of donor and acceptor (shown schematically in Figure  4 b), 
which enable the surface area of the dissociating interface to 
be dramatically increased. This effect manifests as an effective 
enhancement of  L D which, in turn, enables the optimal device 
thickness to be increased as shown in Figure  5 . However, as 
the interpenetration of the donor–acceptor network increases 
the pathways for charge collection become hindered, which 
is also a common limitation even in planar structures where 
 α L C can be  < 1. Indeed the mobility (  μ ) of organic semiconduc-
tors is generally quite low, in the range of 10  − 7 cm 2 V  − 1 s  − 1 ) to 
10 cm 2 V  − 1 s  − 1 . [ 22 ] Thus, there is a sensitive interplay between 
high photocurrent generation and charge collection that requires 
careful morphology optimization. While solid state BHJ struc-
tures typically suffer from the hindered carrier transport, they 
nonetheless remain the highest-performing solid-state nano-PV 
cells to date. Alternative approaches to simultaneously increase 
 η ED and   η CC include 1) long-range ordering which can effec-
tively increase both  L D [ 23–25 ] and charge mobility [ 22 ] or 2) molec-
ular design of highly absorptive materials (with high values of 
 α ) or effective light trapping schemes to reduce the required 
thicknesses while maintaining high absorption efﬁ ciency. [ 26 ] 
 The energy-level offset at the bilayer junction interface 
impacts the open-circuit voltage. For such donor–acceptor 
organic cells, the maximum  V OC has been shown in several 
studies to be proportional to the “interface gap” as outlined 
in Figure  4 , where the dark current is limited through charge 
recombination at the heterojunction interface due the energy-
level offset at the junction. [ 27 , 28 ] Non-optimized electrode work 
functions can further reduce  V OC from this maximum by cre-
ating charge collection barriers that can result in a build-up 
of space charge. [ 29 ] For ohmic contacts, the maximum  V OC for 
bilayer organic cells can be expressed as [ 28 ]

where  E LUMO

 is the acceptor lowest unoccupied molecular 
orbital (LUMO) energy,  E HOMO
D
 is the donor highest occupied 
molecular orbital (HOMO) energy, and  EBE is the interface 
charge-transfer (CT) state binding energy. With optimized 
donor–acceptor energy levels, the interface gap is still ulti-
mately constrained by the smaller of the optical gaps minus the 
binding energy. Accordingly, organic heterojunctions exhibit a 
wide range of photovoltages for various donor/acceptor com-
binations with similar optical gaps, as shown in Figure  1 . For 
 L D ) to the exciton-dissociating bilayer interfaces. As thicker 
layers are needed to absorb more light and thinner layers 
are desired to facilitate excitons reaching dissociative bilayer 
interfaces, the tradeoff requires optimization of the nano-PV 
layer thickness for the maximized device performance. The 
 EQE  can therefore be described in terms of the constituent 
efﬁ ciencies as  EQE  =  η A η ED η CT η CC where   η A is the absorp-
tion efﬁ ciency,   η ED is the exciton diffusion efﬁ ciency,   η CT is

PROGRESS REPORT
the surveyed nano-PVs we ﬁ nd the photovoltage constrained to 
80% of the SQ voltage, which is roughly equivalent to replacing 
 E G in  Equation 5 with  EG −EBE and ﬁ tting the heuristic of 
 EBE ≈0.17EG . Although polymer solar cells are similarly 
limited in photovoltage by  Equation 7 , reduction of this loss 
has recently led to  V OC ’s surpassing those of other nano-PV 
technologies. [ 30–32 ] 
 Certiﬁ ed power conversion efﬁ ciencies reaching 6% to 8% 
have already been reported for both vapor-deposited small 
molecule and polymer solution-processed cells with spectral 
responsivities from  λ  = 350 nm to   λ  = 800 nm. [ 33–37 ] Future 
improvements will need to focus on maintaining low inter-
face recombination (i.e., through interface engineering), 
extending absorption deeper into the infrared while simul-
taneously maintaining the high photocurrents and charge 
collection efﬁ ciencies already achieved in the 
best devices. Accordingly, this will require a 
combination of morphology optimization 
and material engineering of molecules with 
long diffusion length, high carrier mobilities, 
and smaller bandgaps. Indeed, engineering 
optical gaps in organic molecules into the 
infrared remains a signiﬁ cant challenge, one 
that may be overcome through the use of 
hybrid material systems such as organic/col-
loidal-quantum-dot or organic/nanotube [ 38 , 39 ] 
combinations. Stacked structures in which 
each stacked cell can be optimized for a dif-
ferent wavelength range may also be key to 
enabling efﬁ cient harvesting of light at longer 
wavelengths. [ 3 , 36 , 40 , 41 ] 
 4.2. Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC) 
 High efﬁ ciency, DSSC cells with certiﬁ ed   η p  = 
11% have been demonstrated utilizing Ru-
based organic dyes with absorption from the 
UV to   λ  = 800 nm (Figure  1 , 2 ). [ 34 , 42 ] These 
high power conversion efﬁ ciencies are largely 
attributable to near unity internal quantum 
efﬁ ciencies ( IQE ) and ﬁ ll factors around 
70%. DSSCs are a form of organic BHJ struc-
ture that have demonstrated nearly complete 
decoupling of exciton diffusion and absorp-
tion efﬁ ciency through the formation of an 
intercalated dissociating interface between a 
monolayer of dye molecules and a nanostruc-
tured acceptor layer. The high ﬁ ll-factors stem 
from the replacement of molecular acceptors 
with a high electron-mobility inorganic semi-
conductor, typically a sintered mesoporous 
TiO 2 , along with a highly conductive liquid 
electrolyte to efﬁ ciently extract charges. 
Although little advance has been made 
in terms of increasing   η P since the early 
reports, a number of different dye systems 
have approached this high level of perform-
ance (Figure  2 ). [ 43–45 ] Recent reviews of DSSC 
PVs can be found in ref.  [13 ] and  [46 ] . Exploring the divergence 
of the demonstrated DSSC power conversion efﬁ ciencies from 
the calculated limits indicates that the shortfall in efﬁ ciency is 
mostly due to the low photovoltage. This low  V OC likely results 
from a combination of direct charge recombination from the 
TiO 2 to the triiodide redox mediator and the low conduction 
band energy of TiO 2 , or low interface gap, where  Equation 7 
is directly applicable to DSSC cells. Indeed, the observed  V OC 
values remain signiﬁ cantly lower than other organic–polymer 
cells of similar bandgap. 
 Operational stability may also be an issue in liquid-phase 
DSSC due to the volatile electrolyte. Recent efforts have there-
fore focused on the development of solid-state hole transport 
layers (HTL), with record efﬁ ciencies for these devices of 
around 5–6%. [ 47–52 ] In several of these cases direct substitution

. The  EQE is plotted in Figure  5 b 
as a function of  d / W for various values of   α W and  L C / W. Photo-
current is primarily generated in the depletion region of width, 
 W,  where exciton dissociation and carrier drift are aided by 
the built-in potential. For large carrier collection efﬁ ciencies, 
current can also be contributed from the quasineutral region. 
Therefore, ﬁ nding techniques to increase the carrier mobility 
of these ﬁ lms, for example by employing inorganic ligands, [ 67 ] 
decreasing inter-CQD spacing, [ 68 ] or employing superlat-
tice ordering of CQDs, [ 61 ] could lead to larger optimal devices 
thicknesses and a near doubling of photocurrents over devices 
at the present state of the art. The near-IR response of CQD 
solar cells is currently limited by low absorption coefﬁ cients 
and low optimum thicknesses of the CQD layers. Additionally, 
the ability to control the doping levels [ 69 ] and tune the effective 
dielectric constants in capped CQDs via ligand control can lead 
to enhanced depletion widths, which has already been shown to 
be critical in controlling the performance of CQD devices. [ 68 ] 
 5. Ultimate Performance of the Third-Generation 
PV Concepts 
 A number of architectures have been proposed for reducing 
losses in solar cells in order to overcome the SQ single-junction 
limit. These include hot carrier solar cells, [ 13 , 70 ] intermediate 
band solar cells, [ 13 , 71 ] up- and down-converters, [ 72 ] and concen-
trators, [ 13 , 73 ] as well as cells that utilize multiple-exciton genera-
tion, [ 6 , 74 ] exciton ﬁ ssion, [ 6 , 74 ] and tandem stacking. [ 11 , 13 ] While 
all of these approaches hold promise, this review focuses on the 
latter three, in which nanostructured materials are particularly 
relevant. 
 5.1. Multiple Exciton Generation in PVs 
 One approach for overcoming the SQ single-junction limit in 
CQD systems is through the use of multiple exciton genera-
tion (MEG). The MEG process is shown in Figure  3 whereby 
multiple carriers are generated from one hot-excited state. In 
quantum conﬁ ned materials, it is suggested that the increased 
discretization of energy levels should lead to reduced carrier 
cooling rates, allowing MEG to become competitive with carrier 
relaxation. [ 59 ]  MEG efﬁ ciency limits have recently been reviewed 
by Nozik, where theoretical maximum efﬁ ciencies with MEG 
(“inﬁ nite staircase”) in the SQ limit were calculated to be   η P  = 
44%, signiﬁ cantly exceeding the  η P  = 33% of the single-junction 
limit. [ 74 ] The onset threshold for ideal MEG occurs at  nE G , where 
is  n is an integer multiplication number. Under AM1.5 illumi-
nation, PVs enhanced by the MEG process can add substantial 
additional photocurrent only when the PV photoactive layer has 
 E G  < 1.5eV. This can be seen in Figure  1 , 2 where we calculate 
the practical efﬁ ciency limit for the idealized “two-staircase” 
MEG (labeled “M2 MEG”) and show that the practical efﬁ ciency 
limit increases from 17.1% for the single junction cell with no 
MEG to 21.8% for PVs enhanced by M2 MEG. To date, no PV 
efﬁ ciency improvements resulting in  EQE  > 100% have been 
of the tri-iodide electrolyte solution for a solid state HTL typi-
cally reduced the efﬁ ciency by approximately two-fold due 
to reduction in the  FF and  J SC and is suggestive of a need 
for higher mobility solid state HTLs in both DSSC and OPV 
structures. Again, tailoring organic dyes with absorption into 
the near-infrared (with1.1 eV bandgap) remains a challenge 
for improving DSSC efﬁ ciencies as well. Alternatively, DSSC 
devices with colloidal quantum dot light absorption centers 
with near infrared bandgaps could be viable in generating 
higher  V OC . [ 51 , 53–55 ] 
 4.3. Colloidal Quantum Dot PVs 
 CQDs are hybrid materials composed of nanocrystal cores of 
inorganic semiconductors, capped with (typically) organic lig-
ands. The distinguishing feature of colloidal quantum dots is 
the ﬁ nite nanocrystal size that leads to electronic conﬁ nement, 
tunable band structure, and improved processability as com-
pared to their bulk semiconductor counterparts. CQDs, com-
pared to most small molecule and polymer semiconductors, 
exhibit very large effective dielectric constants. For example [ 56 , 57 ] 
 ε PbS  = 15–20 (bulk PbS [ 58 ]  = 170) and   ε PbSe  = 12–50 (bulk 
PbSe [ 58 ]  = 210) for ethylene-dithiol-capped PbS CQD. These 
large bulk dielectric constants lead to large effective Bohr radii 
(of between 10 and 20 nm) and hence make quantum conﬁ ne-
ment effects important in particles of this size. Conﬁ nement 
can impact the optical gap [ 59 ] which can be tuned over a range 
of meV to eV, providing a method to move through  E G -space in 
Figure  1 , 2 . The exciton binding energy, which is proportional [ 60 ] 
to 1/ ε 2 , is therefore small ( < kT ), indicating that free-carrier 
and ﬁ eld-driven dissociation are typically dominant, at least 
within individual CQDs. [ 61 ] Therefore, in contrast to molecular, 
polymeric, and DSSC PVs, the CQD PVs do not require a het-
erojunction for carrier dissociation, but rather excitons can 
dissociate within the CQD thin ﬁ lm bulk. Solution-deposited 
CQD Schottky diodes have recently been constructed with ben-
zenediothiol (BDT)-capped-PbS CQDs exhibiting   η P  ≈ 4% and 
internal quantum efﬁ ciencies approaching 80%. [ 62 ] Metal oxide/
PbS-CQD n–p junctions have also been reported with   η P  = 
5.7% [ 63 ] and  > 1000 hour lifetime. [ 64 ] 
 Without the bottleneck of exciton diffusion, CQD PVs are 
limited only by low light absorption efﬁ ciencies, low charge car-
rier mobility, and depletion widths that limit the optimal ﬁ lm 
thickness. The charge transport through CQD ﬁ lms is similar 
to organic semiconductors in that various forms of variable-
range carrier hopping have been observed, [ 57 ] while charge car-
rier mobilities are similar in magnitude to the amorphous and 
crystalline organic layers. [ 65 , 66 ] 
 For Schottky diodes (or p–n junctions with an optically trans-
parent wide-bandgap p-region) with CQD layer thickness of  d, the 
external quantum efﬁ ciency is a function of both the efﬁ ciency of 
current generation in the depleted (  η Dr ) and quasineutral regions 
( η Diff ) of the CQD ﬁ lm, where  E QE = (ηDr ηCT + ηDif ηCT)ηCC
f
 . 
For  d  <  W (where  W is the width of the charge deple-
tion region),   η Diff  = 0,   η CC  = 1 due to drift collection, and 
 ηDr = T(1 −exp (−αd)) where   η CT is the ﬁ eld-dependent 
charge dissociation efﬁ ciency, assumed to be 1 due to the small 
exciton binding energy. For  d  >  W ,  ηDr = T(1 −exp(−αW)) ,

reported, hence the beneﬁ t of the MEG enhancement in PVs 
has not yet been demonstrated. As the measurements of MEG 
processes are still evolving, we can assess the practical beneﬁ t 
of implementing the MEG process in PVs by comparing it to 
equivalent processes that have been extensively studied such as 
the impact ionization (or the reverse of the Auger recombina-
tion process), which to date has been demonstrated to be only 
weakly present in most bulk inorganic semiconductors. [ 75 ] Like-
wise, recent measurements show that the overall magnitude of 
MEG in CQD ﬁ lms is also limited, with onset thresholds and 
multiplication-proﬁ les that are far from ideal [ 59 , 76–79 ] or overes-
timated due to charging effects. [ 80 , 81 ] Calculations show that if 
the MEG proﬁ le onset thresholds are less than M2 MEG, the 
expected achievable   η P is nearly identical to that for PV cells 
without MEG. [ 74 , 78 ] Altogether, this limits the potential for   η P 
enhancements through an MEG process, with the beneﬁ t of 
MEG enhancement of PVs only present if nearly ideal MEG 
process can be achieved for small gap materials. 
 5.2. Singlet Exciton Fission in PVs 
 The singlet exciton ﬁ ssion (SF) in organic semiconductors is a 
nearly equivalent analog of MEG in CQDs. In the SF process, 
one high energy singlet exciton at the band edge spontane-
ously separates to form two triplet excitons, each with ≤1/2 
(singlet energy)  ± kT . While this process has been observed for 
a range of polyacene crystals, [ 82–85 ] the quantum mechanical 
mechanism has only recently been explored. [ 86 ] Ideal SF can 
result in a doubling of the photogenerated current at a given 
bandgap [ 87 ] and has been suggested as a method for slightly 
increasing multijunction PV efﬁ ciencies through improved cur-
rent matching. [ 6 , 88 ] Moreover, it has been speculated that access 
to the triplet state could lead to enhanced diffusion lengths and 
bridge the gap between experimentally observed and theoreti-
cally predicted maximum photocurrents. [ 87 , 89 ] Although triplet 
diffusions lengths can sometimes exceed those of the singlet 
exciton, [ 24 , 25 ] triplet formation in the absence of singlet ﬁ ssion 
results in additional thermalization losses that lower the max-
imum efﬁ ciency below the practical limit calculated here. This 
is highlighted in a recent report of  IQE  > 100% for SF in a pen-
tacene-C 60 and tetracene-C 60 bilayer architectures where overall 
 EQE at zero bias and power efﬁ ciency still remain lower than 
other combinations of similar optical gap. [ 87 , 90 ] 
 The triplet states have negligible oscillator strength (even 
smaller than the MEG process) and there are rarely other opti-
cally absorptive states between the lowest singlet and triplet 
levels. Therefore, for our analysis  E G  =  E S is used as the optical 
gap in  Equation 3 to determine the photocurrent resulting 
from the absorbed incident light, while  E G  =  E T  = 1/2 E S is used 
in  Equation 5 to determine the carrier level or  V OC for spon-
taneous ﬁ ssion. In Figure  1 , 2 we refer to this case as “SF1”. 
We note that while the ideal MEG process in CQD ﬁ lms acts 
similarly to stacking tandem PV cells (as discussed below), 
singlet ﬁ ssion in a single organic thin ﬁ lm layer does not. In 
the SF1 case the maximum achievable   η P is lower than for the 
single junction cells that do not exhibit singlet ﬁ ssion because 
the decrease in the open circuit voltage is more severe than the 
gain in the photocurrent (Figure  1 ). If the  V OC scaled exactly as 
 E G  (i.e., without an offset) as assumed by Beard and Nozik, then 
the efﬁ ciency limit would be unchanged from the M1 case. [ 91 ] 
 An alternative device conﬁ guration utilizing SF in a PV is 
with a donor-acceptor pair consisting of an SF material with 
large bandgap that forms a junction with a non-SF material 
whose gap is half as large (vis, same as the triplet gap). This 
case, which we refer to as “SF2” in Figure  1 , 2 , results in the 
same maximum   η P as the M2 MEG case. Additionally, this 
approach would require structured absorption in the low-
gap material so that higher energy photons are preferentially 
absorbed only within the SF layer and not thermalized in the 
non-SF layer. The SF2 pairing would therefore be less compat-
ible with BHJ and DSSC architectures [ 90 , 92 ] where such optical 
engineering becomes more challenging and would result in 
thermal losses approaching the M1 scenario. Figure  3 outlines 
both SF1 and SF2 schemes. 
 5.3. Tandem PVs 
 The tried method for simultaneously reducing thermalization 
and absorption losses is to stack multiple cells with varying 
bandgaps, so that each cell absorbs a different part of the solar 
spectrum. Indeed, this approach has led to record PV efﬁ cien-
cies of 42.3% with GaInP/GaInAs/Ge two-terminal, triple junc-
tion cells. [ 2 ] While tandem stacking of high efﬁ ciency inorganic 
cells is limited by epitaxial growth considerations (i.e., lattice 
matching) and can add substantial cost to PV fabrication, 
nanostructured materials do not have such restrictions. This 
makes tandem growth of nano-PVs feasible on arbitrary sub-
strates and with arbitrary combinations of subcells, as already 
demonstrated for molecular PV structures. [ 93 ] 
 Tandem stacking of multiple cells requires matching the 
photocurrents (for series connection) or photovoltages (for 
parallel connection) of the stacked subcells (i.e., matching max-
imum power points). Series matching generally leads to higher 
efﬁ ciencies since cells in parallel are limited by the voltage of 
the lowest gap cell. [ 72 ] However, parallel tandem junctions can 
also exhibit better light-shading stability where the photovoltage 
is logarithmic with light intensity and therefore could be useful 
under highly variable illumination conditions. [ 94 ] Therefore, in 
contrast to the MEG and SF approaches, excess thermal energy 
in tandem structures can be utilized to build either current (in 
parallel integration) or voltage (in series stacking). Utilizing the 
assumptions of SQ, the maximum efﬁ ciency for series two-cell, 
three-cell, and inﬁ nite number of tandem cells are 43%, 48%, 
and 67%, respectively. [ 74 ] However, assuming a non-idealized 
PV performance (discussed before for the M1 case in Figure  2 ), 
we calculate a maximum practical laboratory power conver-
sion efﬁ ciency of 24% for a stacked, current-matched, two-cell 
nano-PV tandem structure (compared to the predicted 43.4% 
in the SQ limit). This performance is slightly better than the 
maximum  η P for M2 MEG or SF2. 
 While tandem architectures for small-molecule and polymer 
PVs have been demonstrated, full optimization of such struc-
tures will require subcells with responsivity deeper into the 
near IR (NIR). Accordingly, tandem PVs could be designed 
from a combination of CQD and organic containing subcells, 
where the infrared responsivity of CQD layers can complement

PROGRESS REPORT
the visible spectrum response of organic layers, provided that 
future CQD subcells can be optimized for complete NIR 
absorption. We also note that tandem stacking of two or more 
identical PV cells (cells with the same  E G ) can help in over-
coming deleterious effects of series resistance that reduce 
 FF . [ 95 ] For a given light absorption, such a stacked geometry 
would reduce the active layer thicknesses of individual sub-
cells, which would diminish exciton diffusion and charge col-
lection losses, particularly for CQD devices with ﬁ xed deple-
tion widths or organic materials with ﬁ xed exciton diffusion 
lengths. [ 36 , 96 , 97 ]  
 6. Projected Cost of Nano-PV Technologies 
 As the efﬁ ciencies of nanostructured solar cells advance toward 
the limits discussed above, the critical determinant of their 
commercial viability will be the levelized energy cost (LEC) of 
electricity they produce, in $ kW  − 1 h  − 1 , relative to the incum-
bent means of energy production including electricity from 
fossil fuel power plants and from other PV technologies. The 
LEC is a suitable metric because it can readily be compared 
to the present-day costs of coal and gas-generated electricity. 
It also accounts for variable module lifetime, to be discussed 
in detail in the next section, as well as the balance of systems 
(BOS) costs. [ 98 ] 
 Presently, the PV contribution to USA electricity genera-
tion is less than 0.2%. [ 99 ] If the USA PV deployment continues 
to rise at the recently seen [ 100 ] 40% year-to-year growth rate, it 
would take 15 years for PV technologies to account for 20% 
of USA electricity production (note that at a slower, but still 
high, year-to-year growth rate of 25%, it would take over 20 
years to reach 20% of USA electricity production). We set 20% 
as a target PV penetration in USA electricity production, since 
for the foreseeable future, inputs into the USA electrical grid 
from intermittent renewable energy sources, such as PVs, are 
expected to be limited to between 10% and 20% due to issues of 
grid stability. [ 101 ] Advancements of energy storage and “smart-
grid” technologies would increase the allowable fraction of 
intermittent power sources on the electrical grid. Therefore, we 
expect that in the next two decades PV technology can aim to 
displace at most 20% of the non-renewable energy generation, 
with the biggest economic beneﬁ t provided when displacing the 
presently most expensive electrical energy. To estimate the LEC 
cost targets that need to be met, we plot in  Figure  6 the cost 
of USA electricity across all sectors (residential, commercial, 
and industrial) integrated over kW h consumed. [ 102 ] The 20% of 
the most expensive electricity consumed in the USA cost more 
than $0.12 kW  − 1 h  − 1 , setting this as a near-term target of the 
cost-competitive LEC for the nano-PV generated electricity. LEC 
of approximately $0.05 kW  − 1 h  − 1 would be needed to compete 
with all modes of electricity generation across all sectors. We 
note that subsidies for oil and fossil fuel-based energy have 
been estimated to outnumber those for renewable sources of 
energy by roughly a factor of three. [ 103 ] A reversal in this trend 
could substantially shift the LEC competition point in a direc-
tion favorable for PV technologies. 
 To assess LEC sensitivity to lifetime, efﬁ ciency, and module 
cost, we estimate the LEC according to: [ 104 , 105 ]
 L EC = ICC1000C RF
C F8760
+ O&M  
(8) 
 ICC is the installed capital cost ($ W P  − 1 ) (where W P refers 
to the watts of power generated under peak illumination con-
ditions), deﬁ ned as the sum of the module and BOS costs 
($ m  − 2 ) divided by power (W m  − 2 ) produced;  CF is the capacity 
factor, which takes into account considerations such as diurnal 
and seasonal variation in insolation, assumed to be 15.5% (e.g., 
Kansas City); [ 105 , 106 ] O&M are operations and maintenance 
costs, assumed to be 0.001 $ kW  − 1 h  − 1 . [ 104 , 107 ] Finally, CRF is the 
capital recovery factor:
 C RF =
i(i + 1)n
i(i + 1)n −1 
(9)  
 The interest rate ( i ) is assumed to be either 6% or 10% and  n 
is the useful operating lifetime of the PV module system. 
 For reference, the module costs of OPV and DSSC mod-
ules have been previously estimated to be in the range of 20 
to 40 $ m  − 2 and 45 to 120 $ m  − 2 , respectively. [ 106 ] BOS costs 
have been estimated for several types of module installation 
including ground-mounted systems (40 to 90 $ m  − 2 ), commer-
cial rooftop mounting with glass substrates/superstrates (75 to 
135 $ m  −  2 ), and rooftop systems with modules based on ﬂ ex-
ible laminates (54 to 99 $ m  −  2 ). [ 106 , 107 ] These ﬁ gures are based 
on the assumption that best practices for manufacturing and 
installation are similar to those of other thin ﬁ lm PV technolo-
gies (e.g., CdTe, copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS), 
amorphous(a)-Si). [ 108 ] 
 In  Figure  7 a we consider a conservative scenario in which 
the nano-PV module cost is 75 $ m  −  2 and the rooftop-mounted 
BOS cost is also 75 $ m  −  2 . The LEC is calculated for such mod-
ules with lifetimes ranging from 5 to 20 years and with power 
conversion efﬁ ciency ranging from 5% to 25%. Additionally, we

a greater amenability to integration with existing infrastructure 
(building-integrated photovoltaics), which could signiﬁ cantly 
reduce the amount of dedicated framing/support required for 
installation. Such optimization and integration is expected to 
substantially lower BOS costs. [ 107 , 110 ] 
 7. Operating Lifetime of Nano PVs 
 The inherently nanostructured forms of DSSCs, molecular 
and polymeric organic PVs (OPVs), and CQD PVs can lead to 
instabilities in their operation under thermal and optical stress, 
which do not affect conventional monolithic inorganic PVs. For 
example, DSSCs could suffer electrolyte leakage under thermal 
expansion and bleaching or desorption of the photopactive 
dye; [ 111 ] OPVs could undergo morphological change to the active 
layer and photo-oxidation under environmental exposure; [ 112 , 113 ] 
and CQD PVs are often subject to loss of ligands that passivate 
the QD surface and can undergo rapid oxidation of the semi-
conductor shell/core. [ 114 ] Additional degradation mechanisms 
include indium diffusion from the indium tin oxide (ITO) elec-
trode [ 115 ] and delamination or oxidation of the low-work-func-
tion cathode. [ 116 ] Nonetheless, some of these challenges have 
already been overcome in the similar ﬁ eld of organic light-emit-
ting diodes, where long lifetimes ( > 10 years) [ 117 , 118 ] have been 
demonstrated and commercialization is well underway. 
 Plots in Figure  7 shows us that in an assessment of a nano-
PV technology in terms of $ kW  − 1 h  − 1 , the useful lifetime of 
the device, typically reported as  T 80 (the time for the device to 
decay to 80% of its initial performance under standard oper-
ating conditions), is as important as the initial efﬁ ciency. Stand-
ardized conditions and procedures for lifetime testing are thus 
necessary for the effective comparison of different device archi-
tectures and encapsulation methods. A frequently employed 
accelerated lifetime testing method consists of a 1000 hour 
light soak under constant AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm  − 2 ) 
and elevated temperature (50–60  ° C) with continual moni-
toring of the photovoltaic operational parameters ( J SC ,  V OC ,  FF , 
and PCE). [ 111 , 119 ] This submits the device to roughly the same 
consider in Figure  7 b the impact of realizing the full low-cost 
potential of nano-PV by calculating the LEC assuming the lowest 
estimated module cost of 20 $ m  −  2 . Finally, Figure  7 c shows the 
same calculations from Figure  7 b, but with the interest rate 
lowered from  i  = 10% to  i  = 6% (the best-case cost scenario). 
 For each of the plots in Figure  7 we ﬁ nd that the LEC ﬂ attens 
out as the module efﬁ ciency or lifetime increases suggesting 
that the steepest gains in LEC occur with improvements of 
relatively low module efﬁ ciencies and lifetimes. For the most 
conservative assumptions of module and BOS cost utilized 
(Figure  7 a), modules with lifetimes  n  ≥ 15 years and  η P  ≥ 15% 
result in the cost-competitive LEC ≤ 0.12 $ kW  − 1 h  − 1 , enabling 
their market penetration. By lowering the module cost from 
75 $ m  −  2 to 20 $ m  −  2  (as in Figure  7 b), nano-PVs can reach cost-
competitive LEC with a 10 year lifetime and   η P  ≥ 12%, a power 
conversion efﬁ ciency achievable within the practical efﬁ ciency 
limits estimated above. Reduction in the ﬁ nancing interest 
(as in Figure  7 c) would further reduce the requirements for 
nano-PVs with cost-competitive LEC to   η P  ≥ 10% and 10 year 
lifetime. In this case, if nano-PV modules are realized close to 
our estimated practical efﬁ ciency limits and with lifetimes of 
between 10 and 20 years, LECs for M1 single and two-junction 
tandem cells of between 0.10 and 0.06 $ kW  − 1 h  − 1 and between 
0.07 and 0.04 $ kW  − 1 h  − 1 are possible, respectively (we take the 
practical laboratory efﬁ ciency limits of 17% and 24% for single- 
and tandem-junction cells, respectively, and multiple by 0.75 to 
estimate the practical module efﬁ ciency limits). [ 109 ] Thus, the 
degree of market penetration will be highly dependent on the 
ability to fully realize the low-cost manufacturing of nano-PVs 
as well as advances in both efﬁ ciency and cell lifetime. 
 Manufacturing cost structures required to reach these LECs 
may be enabled by processing active layers with low-temperature 
vapor-phase or solution processing techniques, often employed 
in the fabrication of nano-PVs. While the ultimate and relative 
cost advantages of these two processing techniques remain 
unclear, the ability to process active layers at low temperatures 
and onto inexpensive ﬂ exible substrates should enable a reduc-
tion in the manufacturing as well as infrastructure costs. For 
example, ﬂ exible and light-weight PV modules will likely have 
 Figure  7 .  Estimated levelized energy cost ($ kW  − 1 h  − 1 ) as a function of both module efﬁ ciency and lifetime for various cost scenarios: a) Scenario of 
an intermediate BOS cost (75 $ m  −  2 ) (estimated for rooftop mounting) and a conservative module cost (75 $ m  −  2 ). b) Scenario of lower-limit module 
cost (20 $ m  −  2 ). c) Best-case scenario with lower-limit module costs and also a reduced ﬁ nancing rate ( i  = 6%). Note that a laboratory efﬁ ciency has 
to be scaled by roughly 0.75 to estimate the losses in scaling to a module efﬁ ciency.

PROGRESS REPORT
 Beyond commercial viability, PV cell lifetime is acute in the 
lifecycle analysis and carbon footprint. To have any impact on 
reducing carbon emission, solar cells require lifetimes longer 
than the energy payback time; since the present PV cells will be 
produced by using electricity that is primarily generated through 
burning of the fossil fuels, the CO 2 emission factor of PVs is 
then inversely proportional to the cell lifetime and efﬁ ciency. For 
example, one recent study calcuated that the energy payback time 
is 4 and 2 years for a 5% and 10% OPV, respectively. [ 123 ] For a life-
time of 15 years, the carbon emission factors for 5% and 10% efﬁ -
cient modules are 110 and 55 kg CO 2 kW P  − 1 , respectively, which 
compares favorably to, for example, the average 2006 European 
electricity CO 2  emission factor of 400 kg CO 2 kW  − 1 ( Table  4 ). [ 123 , 124 ] 
A reduction in the lifetime to 5 years would signiﬁ cantly diminish 
the carbon footprint advantage of nano-PVs, particularly if   η P 
remain below 10%. While the cell lifetime has only a small impact 
on overall cost for  n  > 10 years (Figure  7 ), extending lifetimes well 
beyond this range will have a signiﬁ cant role in the ability to pro-
duce and promote “clean” renewable energy. Nonetheless, with 
widespread adoption of solar and other renewable energy gen-
eration, carbon emission factors in PV production can be further 
reduced to approach near-zero carbon footprints. 
 8. Conclusions 
 We have reviewed the limits to the performance of molecular, 
organic, polymeric, dye-sensitized, and CQD-based solar cells. 
number of optical excitations experienced 
during  ≈ 0.5 years of outdoor operation in 
North America, where the annual mean level 
of irradiance is  ≈ 5 kW hr m  − 2 d. [ 107 ] A rep-
resentative collection of 1000-hour lifetime 
testing results for various nano-PV architec-
tures is compiled in  Table  2 .  
 It should be noted that nano-PVs rarely 
undergo a simple linear decay [ 120 ]  in the efﬁ -
ciency with time, but are often characterized 
by a “burn-in” period involving a relatively 
rapid increase or decay of the initial perform-
ance, followed by a period of slow, linear 
decay. [ 119 , 121 ] Because of O 2 and H 2 O sensi-
tivity [ 120 ] of many of the active layers to deg-
radation, packaging technology will be crucial. [ 121 ] Accordingly, 
catastrophic failures in packaging may also rapidly degrade the 
performance at any point during the test. Given the unpredict-
able nature of device degradation, extended lifetime tests under 
conditions approximating those expected under normal opera-
tion, either in an outdoor environment or under repeated illu-
mination and heating cycles, are particularly relevant. A sample 
of extended lifetime testing results for DSSCs and OPVs is com-
piled in  Table  3 and indicates that, with effective encapsulation 
strategies, the lifetime of these nanostructured PVs can be rela-
tively long. Toyoda et al . report a relative degradation of only 16% 
for a DSSC after 2.5 years of outdoor testing, [ 122 ] and Pfeiffer et 
al. observe no signiﬁ cant degradation of a 6% tandem OPV after 
5000 hours of constant 1.5 sun illumination under open-circuit 
conditions. [ 95 ] Ultimately, addressing lifetime and efﬁ ciency 
simultaneously will be critical in determining the adequacy of 
nano-PV technologies for electricity production. Device efﬁ ciency 
and lifetime are not necessarily independent. Sensitivity to UV 
photons, for instance, may contribute to a slightly higher initial 
PV cell efﬁ ciency, but at the expense of a faster cell degradation.

We have considered the speciﬁ c challenges associated with 
improving the power conversion efﬁ ciency of each and ana-
lyzed beneﬁ ts of several approaches for reduced thermal losses 
beyond the single bandgap limit. Critical considerations related 
to the module lifetime and cost that are unique to nano-PV 
architectures have been quantiﬁ ed. While there may be sub-
stantial niche markets for low-cost and low-efﬁ ciency PV (i.e., 
point of source PV utilization), the scaling required to have 
a signiﬁ cant impact on energy markets will most likely be 
achieved through PV systems for grid power generation. Our 
analysis suggests that a practical single-junction laboratory PCE 
limit of 17% and a two-cell tandem PCE of 24% are achievable. 
When combined with operating lifetimes of 10 to 15 years, such 
performance could indeed position nano-PV cells as a transfor-
mational technology for solar energy markets.

Abstract: The growth of the world’s energy demand over recent decades in relation to energy intensity
and demography is clear. At the same time, the use of renewable energy sources is pursued to
address decarbonization targets, but the stochasticity of renewable energy systems produces an
increasing need for management systems to supply such energy volume while guaranteeing, at the
same time, the security and reliability of the microgrids. Locally distributed energy storage systems
(ESS) may provide the capacity to temporarily decouple production and demand. In this sense,
the most implemented ESS in local energy districts are small–medium-scale electrochemical batteries.
However, hydrogen systems are viable for storing larger energy quantities thanks to its intrinsic high
mass-energy density. To match generation, demand and storage, energy management systems (EMSs)
become crucial. This paper compares two strategies for an energy management system based on
hydrogen-priority vs. battery-priority for the operation of a hybrid renewable microgrid. The overall
performance of the two mentioned strategies is compared in the long-term operation via a set of
evaluation parameters deﬁned by the unmet load, storage eﬃciency, operating hours and cumulative
energy. The results show that the hydrogen-priority strategy allows the microgrid to be led towards
island operation because it saves a higher amount of energy, while the battery-priority strategy
reduces the energy eﬃciency in the storage round trip. The main contribution of this work lies in the
demonstration that conventional EMS for microgrids’ operation based on battery-priority strategy
should turn into hydrogen-priority to keep the reliability and independence of the microgrid in the
long-term operation.

1. Introduction
The world energy demand is peaking over the past decades as a result of energy intensity and
demographic growth [1]. At the same time, with the challenging targets of Renewable Energy Sources
(RES), energy conversion systems deployment are globally pursued to address the decarbonization of
the energy sector [2,3]. The increase of the penetration of stochastic renewable energy systems (such as
wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems) produces an increasing need for control and management
systems to supply such energy volume while guaranteeing, at the same time, the security and reliability
of microgrids.
Locally distributed energy storage systems (ESS) [4–7] may provide the capacity to temporally
decouple production and demand, providing versatility and ﬂexibility in the operation of the microgrid.
In particular, the most implemented ESS in local districts are small–medium-scale electrochemical
batteries [8]. However, hydrogen systems are also viable as ESS for storing larger energy quantities
over the long term thanks to the intrinsic high mass-energy density of hydrogen (Lower Heating
Value LHV equal to 33 kWh/kg) which can be implemented in modular systems [9–15]. In this sense,
hydrogen can play a key role as storage media over the long term. The correct balance between power
and energy should be pursued following the speciﬁc operational requirements.
To match generation, load and storage, energy management strategies become of crucial
importance: the development and implementation of control strategies that manage the power
ﬂuxes are fundamental to maintain and optimize the reliability, eﬃciency and operation of the
microgrid in a distributed topology [16]. For the case of small-to-medium scale capacities (from several
kW up to hundreds of kW or even few MW) intensive research has been made to study the behavior of
hybrid renewable microgrids both connected to the main power grid or in island mode [17–20].
The control mechanisms described in the literature range from simple power balance strategies
based on control variable monitoring (maintaining each component in its suitable operation condition
range) [5,6,21,22], up to complex control strategies such as load management based on baseload and peak
load [23] hierarchical control (master-slave) [24,25], model predictive control [4,26], global optimization
via objective functions [27], self-optimization strategies [24] and fuzzy logic [27–29] and genetic
algorithms [30]. Hydrogen-priority strategy in small scale hybrid microgrids with a hydrogen battery
storage system is quite uncommon in scientiﬁc literature, except for few studies with combined
solutions [6,21,31] or hydrogen-only storage systems [4]. Battery-priority strategies are the typical
high-level control systems implemented for short/medium-term microgrid management found in the
literature [5,20,22,27,30,32]. A comprehensive review of diﬀerent microgrid management systems can
be found in [33].
In this paper, an energy management system (EMS) with two strategies based on hydrogen-priority
and battery-priority is proposed for the operation of a hybrid renewable microgrid, implementing
selective power balance based on the control variable monitoring. The aim of the comparison is to
assess the microgrid’s performance in the long-term regarding the internal reliability of the microgrid
and energy eﬃciency. Hydrogen can exploit the greater energy inertia to lead the microgrid towards
island operation (zero support from the main power grid). On the other hand, the battery-priority
approach attempts to minimize the amount of energy lost in the storage round trip, since the nominal
eﬃciency of battery systems is considerably higher than the one of hydrogen systems. Respect to most
of the analyzed literature, which attempts to optimize the real-time operation of the microgrid from an
electrical point of view with simulations in the short-term [20], the main novelty of this paper is it
investigates the microgrid performance in the long-term from an electrical and energetic standpoint.
The evaluation is done over an annual timescale under both strategies: hydrogen-priority compared to
a typical battery-priority. The results obtained endorse the main contribution of the paper: an analysis
about EMS based on battery-priority, as widely extended, regarding hydrogen-priority in the long-term
microgrid operation. The paper demonstrates that the hydrogen-priority EMS strategy guarantees
better reliability and independence in long-term operation.

2. Materials and Methods
The conception of the microgrid is based on the production of energy entirely obtained from
renewable resources, which guarantees the production and storage of energy with zero CO2 emissions.
The microgrid includes diﬀerent RES power generation systems on several kW scales, together with
similar scale hydrogen and battery storage systems. The architecture integrates a mixed type, AC/DC
electrical topology presenting a high-voltage DC bus (400 V DC) and a standard 1ph-230 V/3ph-400V
AC bus, Figure 1 [22].
Figure 1. The hybrid renewable microgrid at the University of Huelva.
Considering the topology of the renewable microgrid under study, which is located in the “La
Rábida” Campus, at the University of Huelva (Huelva is located in the southwest of Spain), it allows
bidirectional power ﬂow between the main power grid and the microgrid. Considering the integration
method, all the generation and consumption systems are connected to the internal DC bus, supported
by the direct connection of the battery bank.
The renewable generation part is provided by variable renewable resources (solar radiation and
wind), which allow the production of energy upon resource availability. The microgrid facility can be
operated supplying the real demand of the “La Rábida” Campus or to satisfy any desired consumption
proﬁle. This can be done, see Figure 1, through programmable power sources and loads. To guarantee
the power balance at all times, there are two ESSs available. The ﬁrst ESS is a battery bank; the direct
connection of the battery bank to the internal DC bus causes the voltage of DC bus to be stabilized
within the operating range of the battery bank, without the need of using additional bidirectional
converters that could complicate the control of the system. The second ESS is a hydrogen loop,
consisting of an electrolyzer (hydrogen producer), a fuel cell (hydrogen consumer) and a compressed
hydrogen storage tank.
The energy conversion systems and buses are connected by means commercial and customized
power electronic converters. The connected and operating systems are reported in Table 1.

After the microgrid its components have been described in the next section, the following section

3. Modelling of the Microgrid Components
In general, the proposed component modelling approach is an intermediate step between system
and process modelling; in fact, the objective is to obtain an easily customizable model to assess energy
dispatch strategies over yearly simulations in an hourly timestep, without considering transients
and local controllers that operate on the order of seconds. It is supposed that each component will
be equipped with an internal control loop that ensures the component operates in a suitable way
(Maximum Power Point Tracking MPPT algorithms for solar PV, blade pitch control and par regulation
for wind turbines, charge controllers for batteries, etc.) [20,24,25,27].
The proposed model simulates one year (8760 h) with a discrete time step of one hour. An entire
yearly simulation is computed in approximately one minute of simulation, which represents an
acceptable balance between accuracy and computational load to analyze the microgrid response in the
long term.
In the following sections, each component model is discussed in detail. An error analysis is
presented in order to validate the modelling of all the components with respect to the real measured
values under the same operating conditions of the real equipment operating in the real microgrid in
Huelva. The error analysis is presented in terms of average relative error εrel_average, Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). Their precise deﬁnition has been
included in the Notation and Symbols list. The error analysis is reported for each component in the
following Sections 3.1–3.6.
3.1. Solar PV Model
The microgrid in Figure 1 has 15 kW p of solar PV installed (Figure 2), divided into three modules
of 5 kW p of monocrystalline and polycrystalline amorphous thin ﬁlm Si-based technology. The 300 V
solar arrays are connected at the main switchboard in series. By default, the PV production is sent to
an inverter and injected into the main power grid but can be connected directly to the 400 VDC bus by
switching to the DC-DC converters which assure voltage coupling.

The model implemented is taken from [34,35]; it is based on inclined radiation and panel
temperature correction of the short circuit current, ISC, and open-circuit voltage, VOC, Equations (1)
and (2). The total electrical power output of the panel array is calculated by multiplying current and
voltage, equation (3), taking into account the panel array conﬁguration. The panel temperature TP is
calculated from the measured ambient temperature Ta by considering a global heat transfer coeﬃcient
kp (◦C m2/W) [36] which takes into account the global conductive, convective and irradiation heat
inputs to the panel. Equations (1) and (2) are taken from [34,35]:

It can be seen that the model follows within a reasonable approximation of the experimental
measurements (Figure 4). As assessed in the ﬁgure, in all cases the average error committed by the
model is below 5% of the measured values and the normalized error is below 5% of the nominal power
of the PV systems.

3.2. Wind Turbine Model
On the same rooftop as the solar PV systems, a 3 kW horizontal axis micro wind turbine is installed
as shown in Figure 5a. The nominal parameters of the wind turbine are reported in Figure 5b. Similarly
to the PV system, by default the wind turbine injects power to the microgrid but can be set in island
mode by switching the connection to the electrical converters which can connect the wind turbine
either to the AC or to the DC bus (Figure 1).

The 3-kW rated wind turbine will be modelled by implementing its power curve with a cubic
curve as reported in the technical datasheet with a resolution of 1 m/s, Equation (4). The characteristic
values of cut-in and cut-oﬀspeeds determine the limits of operation of the wind turbine. The nominal
wind speed determines the value from which the power output goes from a cubic function to a constant,
thanks to the variable pitch regulation (which is not detailed in this paper) of the turbine blades [37].
In the model of equation (4), constant electrical, mechanical and aerodynamic eﬃciency factors are
considered, equal to 85%, 90% and 90% respectively.

Electronics 2020, 9, 698

By feeding the model with the daily wind speed values for the selected days, it is possible to
validate the model (Figure 6) by comparing the results with the actual power injected to the microgrid.
Figure 6. Validation of the wind turbine model and error analysis.
As can be seen in Figure 6, the power output obtained by the model (in blue) follows the trend of
the experimental data (in orange) with a rather good approximation. The average relative error on a
daily basis is below 8% (the worst case is 03/07) and on average throughout the three days below 6%.
The average RMSE normalized respect to the nominal power of the wind turbine is also below 6%. It is
assumed that, in the long-term annual simulations, the error is smoothened by the increasing amount
of data.
3.3. Alkaline Electrolyzer Model
The microgrid is provided with a 10 kWe alkaline electrolyzer (Figure 7a) with datasheet
characteristics shown in Figure 7b; the nominal production is 2 Nm3/h of hydrogen. The produced gas
is stored, at the outlet pressure of the electrolyzer (30 bar), in a tank, Figure 7a.

The electrolyzer was modelled empirically, due to fact that the electrolyzer SCADA system only
monitors the stack voltage and current allowing the imposition of a power setpoint (expressed as
% of the rated power—see Figure 8b). For this reason, it was assessed to be a more suitable—from
Electronics 2020, 9, 698
9 of 27
a system modelling point of view—more reliable but empirical, model-based interpolation of real
data (see Figure 8a), rather than a more in-depth analytical process model without the means of
validating the involved variables (for example instantaneous gas partial pressure, local cell current
density distribution, water/gas ﬂow rate), which are not accessible for measurement due to the lack of
measurement systems in place required to validate a process model. In addition, the I-V curve trend
and results are in line with the values reported in the literature [38].

(c) 
Figure 8. (a) Alkaline electrolyzer empirical modelling scheme; (b) experimental test procedure
(c) polarization curve (stack) experimental data, polynomial ﬁtting and error analysis.
The empirical model scheme is reported in Figure 8a, interpolating the current and voltage data
according to the empirical I-V curve obtained from experimental testing on the equipment. Due to the
observed near-constant behavior of the voltage (from a system point of view), it is possible to derive a
ﬁrst iteration value of the current by simply dividing the input power setpoint by the nominal voltage.
Once the ﬁrst iteration current has been calculated, a second new value of voltage is calculated via a
cubic spline interpolation on the empirical I-V curve. The iterative method continues, calculating a
second iteration current and so on.
By applying the model to a continuous spectrum of input power from 2 kWe to 10 kWe (20%–100%
of the nominal power) the correspondence of the output current and voltage simulated values respect
to the measurements is veriﬁed, Figure 8b,c. The results can be reﬁned by iterating the process until a
suitable accuracy is reached (εrel <~5% for both current and voltage).
The validation of the model conﬁrms that, from a system point of view, the electrolyzer could
be in the ﬁrst approximation represented by constant voltage and linear current to match the power
setpoint. It has been found that, already at the second iteration, the voltage reduces its average error to
0.43%, and the current reduces its average relative error with respect to the experimental values from
−7.240% to −4.708%.
To calculate the hydrogen ﬂow it is possible to apply Faraday’s Law to obtain the molar ﬂow from
the stoichiometry of the reaction, Equation (5).

ηF is the Faraday eﬃciency (98.5%)
.nH2 is the molar ﬂow of hydrogen (mol/s)

The Faraday eﬃciency is instead dependent on the current density and can be calculated with the
model proposed by Ulleberg [38], at the operating temperature of 60 ◦C, maintained constant by the
cooling system.
3.4. PEM Fuel Cell Model
The PEM fuel cell that is part of the microgrid (Figure 9a) is made up of a stack with 80 single
planar cells in series, with an active surface of 0.0145 m2/cell [39]. Its nominal power is 3.4 kWe,
but due to stack degradation the actual power is limited by the control system to 2 kWe. Datasheet
characteristics are reported in Figure 9b.

Empirical I-V curves were obtained by applying a third-order polynomial ﬁt—Equation (6)—
according to the cubic spline interpolation method with respect to experimental I-V measurements
obtained by testing one fuel cell unit over a power setpoint range from 0 to 2 kW—Figure 10a. Since
the fuel cell power is limited to 2 kWe [40], the fuel cell output power can be considered linear with
reasonable approximation, Equation (7) and Figure 10b, since the concentration loss region is not
reached. By knowing the input power setpoint of the system, the operating current in the linear region
can be determined from the I-P curve; successively, by entering the I-V curve with the found value of
current, the voltage can be determined. The committed average relative error is below 2% with respect
to the median of the experimental values, which are aﬀected by hysteresis in the measured power
setpoint range. The trend of the obtained curves shows correspondence with the literature-reported
data [41,42].

Similarly to the electrolyzer case, from the measured fuel cell current it is possible to obtain the
molar ﬂow from Faraday’s Law, Equation (8). Via successive measurement unit conversions, it is
possible to obtain volumetric and mass ﬂow for each operating point.

40 ◦C, maintained isothermally by the PEM cooling system.
3.5. Compressed Hydrogen Storage Tank Model
Hydrogen produced from the electrolyzer supplying to the fuel cell is stored in a tank with a
volume of 1.044 m3 and a nominal pressure of 30 bar, Figure 11.

Figure 11. (a) Detail of the hydrogen compressed gas tank; (b) layout characteristics.
Hydrogen can be considered as a perfect gas throughout the whole pressure and temperature range
of operation for compressed hydrogen storage [43]. Under this hypothesis, in isothermal conditions,
density is linear with pressure and a linear relationship between pressure and molar quantity can be
obtained by applying the perfect gases law, Equation (9) [24]:
∆n =
∆ptank Vgeom
RT
;
∆ptank = ∆nRT

(9)
where:
∆n is the hydrogen molar variation (mol)
∆ptank is the pressure variation (atm)
R is the perfect gas constant (0.082 atm.L/mol.k)
T is the gas temperature (293 K)
Vgeom is the geometrical tank volume (1.044 L).
The eﬀect of temperature is neglected since the storage tank is stationary and the hydrogen ﬂow
rate is limited.
3.6. Lead-acid Battery Model
A battery bank composed of 34 units of 100 Ah 12 V, based on lead-acid technology, Figure 12a,
in series is directly connected to the DC bus (see Figure 1). Each battery is composed of six elementary
cells in series and the 34 units are connected in series to reach the 400 Vdc of the DC bus. The datasheet

Actual data of current, voltage and state of charge (SOC) obtained from a test-bench during
multiple charge/discharge cycles protocols were utilized in order to ﬁt an empirical two-variable (Ibatt
and SOC) model for the calculation of the battery voltage, diﬀerentiating between charge and discharge
phases. The chosen model was proposed by Tremblay [45] and adapted by Valverde et. al. [31,41];
it consists of two separate relations during charge (Ibatt > 0) and discharge (Ibatt < 0) phases, Equations
(10) and (11). The SOC value has been calculated according to the Coulomb counting method [27,41]
and corrected according to the real battery capacity obtained by Peukert’s Law [46], Equation (12).

The data ﬁtting process is taken out via MATLAB Curve Fitting Toolbox, an additional plug-in for
ﬁtting curves or surfaces to data. The tool is conﬁgured in custom equation mode—Equations (10) to
(12)—using the default nonlinear least square ﬁtting method according to the Trust-Region algorithm.
Ibatt and SOC are selected as the two independent variables and the values of Voc, Q and Rint are ﬁxed
from datasheet; K, A and B are the parameters subject to data ﬁtting via MATLAB Curve Fitting Tool:

The discharge phase is quite linear, therefore a very good approximation (R-square = 0.971, Table 2)
is obtained with the experimental data. The charge phase ﬁtting presents more diﬃculty due to the
non-linear charge protocol; therefore, more experimental data was required to achieve a comparable
approximation (R-square = 0.959, Table 2). In fact, the higher-end SOC range is measured at constant
voltage, narrowing the spectrum of available experimental data for surface ﬁtting. In a real-case
operation, it is diﬃcult that such constant voltage charging conditions occur.
In order to validate the model, it has been applied to the experimental data of a series of ﬁve
successive charge/discharge cycles. In Figure 15a, the measured voltage (in blue) is compared (below)
to the voltage calculated by the model (in red) together with the relative error (Figure 15a below and
Figure 15b) with respect to the measured data. Discontinuities in the voltage proﬁle, such as the one
seen in t = 5 h, are normal and due to the switch from charging to discharging mode during experimental
test. It consists of multiple charging/discharging cycles applied over the battery. In the instant of the
switch, the battery is put in open circuit conditions (returning to around 12 V) and then switched to the
successive charge/discharge phase, allowing the voltage to vary suddenly. The model shows good
accordance with the experimental data (relative error <1% and <3% normalized respect to the nominal
voltage), except for the constant voltage zones during battery charge, as previously discussed.

4. Energy Management System (EMS). Strategies Deﬁnition: Hydrogen- vs. Battery-priority
The complete microgrid model is implemented into Simulink environment in order to perform the
global simulation, Figure 16. The input data are radiation, G, ambient temperature, Ta, and wind speed,
v, obtained by PV-GIS satellite data for the microgrid geographical location (database from 2007 to
2017) [47]. A typical residential load proﬁle has been considered [22]. Each component is parameterized
according to the speciﬁcations of the simulated system, as discussed in Section 3. The sum of the
solar PV power and wind turbine power consists of the total renewable power generated. The total
produced power is compared in each hour timestep with the load power, resulting in a net power Pnet
which should be managed by the ESSs or by the external power grid. If in a speciﬁc timestep the net
power is positive (Pnet > 0), the microgrid presents an energy excess scenario, where the produced
power is greater than the demand power; on the other hand, a negative net power (Pnet < 0) means
a deﬁcit scenario where the load power is greater than the produced power. All the power in the
microgrid is assumed to be exchanged via the 400 V DC bus. The net power balance is converted
into power setpoints to the ESSs, which in turn translate into current setpoints which determines
the charge/discharge behavior of the ESS. As a consequence, the battery SOC and the hydrogen tank
pressure are calculated according to the net balance of hydrogen/battery charge quantity. The SOC and
tank pressure starting values must be initialized.
The EMS computes the net power balance between the total RES generation and the load.
According to the imposed limits of the control variables of battery State of Charge (SOC) and hydrogen
stored in the tanks, computed by the tank pressure ptank. The EMS implements a logical algorithm
according to the decided priority strategy, providing the power setpoint outputs for each component
(electrolyzer, fuel cell, battery and main power grid) [48]. The minimum and maximum limits of
operation of each energy storage is deﬁned according to the technology operation range [19,24], while
low and high limits of each ESS are deﬁned according to the hysteresis amplitude in relation to the
restoration logic [5,22,25,30,31].

4.1. Hydrogen-priority Strategy
For the Hydrogen-priority strategy, the EMS objective is to maximize the internal reliability by
increasing the hydrogen systems utilization. In fact, hydrogen allows greater inertia to be obtained due
to the greater amount of energy (kWh) stored in the form of hydrogen in comparison to the batteries.
This allows larger loads to be continuously supplied with more stable operation of the hydrogen storage.
When the renewable energy supply is higher than the load demand (PRES > PLOAD), the electrolyzer
is put in work with the aim to consume the energy excess and to have energy stored in the form of
hydrogen. In the other case, when solar and wind do not meet the load demand (PRES < PLOAD), it will
be the fuel cell the ﬁrst responsible for supplying the energy deﬁcit. After that, when the hydrogen
tank pressure approaches the limit values (ptank_min and ptank_max) the system shifts the load to the
batteries (both charge and discharge), provided that the SOC is in the suitable range. If the battery SOC
is also not within the suitable operating range (SOCmax, SOCmin), the power is supplied by or injected
into the main power grid, which acts as a support or as “dump” load. To avoid continuous changes in
the operation mode and to support the restoration of unavailable ESSs, a hysteresis bandwidth and
logic has been deﬁned of hydrogen systems and battery bank. That is, if useful power is available and
if the complementary storage system is in a normal operating range, the hydrogen-based systems keep
in near-unavailable condition.
4.2. Battery-Priority Strategy
On the other hand, in the battery-priority strategy, the battery bank is used as the primary energy
backup, using the hydrogen systems only when the SOC is outside of the allowed operation range [22].
The hydrogen loop (electrolyzer and fuel cell) is used as a secondary backup when the batteries are
unavailable. If both systems are outside the suitable operating range, the power is supplied by or
injected into the main power grid, which acts as microgrid support or “dump” load. In a similar way,
the logical structure of the strategy deﬁnes a hysteresis loop, in order to restore an unavailable ESS,
prioritizing the battery bank respect to the hydrogen tank.

4.3. Strategies Comparison and Global Evaluation Parameters
The two strategies are schematized and compared in Figure 17. The system computes the net
power balance between the total RES generation and the load according to the imposed limits of the
control variables of battery State of Charge (SOC) and hydrogen stored in the tanks, computed by the
tank pressure ptank. The EMS implements a logical algorithm according to the decided priority strategy,
providing the power setpoint outputs for each component (electrolyzer, fuel cell, battery and main
power grid) [48]. The minimum and maximum limits of operation of each energy storage system are
deﬁned according to the technical operation range [19,24], while low and high limits of each ESS are
deﬁned according to the hysteresis amplitude in relation to the restoration logic [5,22,25,30,31].

The numerical results of the simulations must be categorized into a set of quantitative evaluation
parameters (Table 3) in order to be able to compare the simulations results obtained from each strategy.
These parameters are aggregate values, which embrace and represent the global system performance
in the long-term.

The cumulative annual energy Ei is equal to the sum of the instantaneous power P (t) multiplied

of Load (LL) is the amount of energy demanded by the load but not supplied by the microgrid;
Loss of Load Probability (LLP%) is the percentage of unmet load respect to the total load demand;
Storage eﬃciency (ηstorage) is the ratio between the energy input to the ESSs (hydrogen production via
electrolysis and battery charging) and the energy output from the ESSs (during the fuel cell operation
and the battery discharging). For the Loss of Load parameter, LL, only the contribution from the
main power grid is considered (Pgrid < 0), while the injection to the main power grid (Pgrid > 0) is not
considered. Load shedding or any kind of active load modiﬁcation (demand response) is neglected.
5. Results
5.1. Simulation Conditions
The long-run simulations are obtained by feeding yearly data (Figure 18) with hourly resolution
into the developed model. The 2016 data was used [47] which represented a worst-case scenario, since
the radiation proﬁle was on average the lowest throughout the 10 years of the database. Since the
RES generation systems are predominantly solar, this represents a worst-case scenario for the storage
system, which must support a more demanding energy deﬁcit scenario.
The considered load [22] is a typical 3–4 kWp (Pinst), 35 kWh/dayavg residential type load proﬁle
as shown in Figure 19. The proﬁle matches the typical working habits of the city environment, where
the starting working hour is around 09:00–10:00, with a valley around 14:00–17:00 and the second peak
from 17:00–18:00 to 21:00–22:00. The seasonal behavior of the load has been assessed by implementing
a correction coeﬃcient which takes into account the seasonal variability of cumulative energy obtained
by the analysis of local loads, Figure 19a.
The long-term simulation has been run for both strategies for 8760 h with a seasonal variable load,
Figure 19a. Figure 19b summarizes the simulated microgrid setup, while Table 4 reports the EMS
parameter conﬁgurations.
In this case a direct comparison of results can be made since the simulated components and
conditions are the same, with only diﬀerent EMS strategies.

6. Discussion
Firstly, both EMS strategies assure that the overall power balance is always met, thanks to the main
power grid intervention. It can be clearly seen in Figure 20 that winter (hours 1–2190) and autumn
(hours 6570–8760) seasons correspond to the main energy deﬁcit periods of the year, due to lesser
solar resources. The predominance of solar systems determines a strong energy excess scenario during
spring and summer (hours 2190–6570). The overall power balance is also aﬀected by the seasonal load
(Figure 19) which is most demanding during summer and least demanding during spring/autumn.
By comparing the results, the priority relevantly aﬀects the overall power balance; in the case of
hydrogen-priority EMS strategy, the hydrogen input energy is 7286 kWh (Table 6, ﬁrst row) versus
only 690 kWh sent to the batteries (Table 6, third row), while in the battery-priority EMS strategy the
hydrogen input energy is only 1226 kWh against 4408 kWh for the batteries. This aspect is reﬂected
also by the amount of hydrogen used, which is equal to 1584 Nm3 for the hydrogen-priority EMS
strategy (several cycles) against 165 Nm3 for the battery-priority EMS strategy (few cycles). In terms
of main power grid energy, the battery-priority EMS strategy injects 9632 kWh and uses 562 kWh
(Table 6, row ﬁve and six). On the other hand, the hydrogen-priority EMS strategy presents a reduced
interaction with the main power grid, both in injection and support mode, respectively 7290 kWh and
254 kWh (Table 6, row ﬁve and six), which accounts for a reduction of 24% in terms of injection energy,
and 55% in terms of main power grid support. Additionally, both EMS strategies were calibrated in
order to accept an energy excess scenario and minimize the main power grid support. In terms of
supply of the load (Table 5, ﬁrst and second row), the hydrogen-priority EMS strategy achieves better
performance (2.05% LLP%) against the battery-priority EMS strategy (4.54% LLP%). The diﬀerence
in the LLP% is not as relevant as the diﬀerence in storage capacity due to the eﬀect of the round-trip
eﬃciency for the two storage pathways, greatly reducing the useful energy for the hydrogen storage.
Global storage eﬃciency (Table 5, third row) is lower for the hydrogen-priority EMS strategy, 50.3%
versus a global storage eﬃciency of 65.5% for the case of battery-priority EMS strategy, which is due to
the diﬀerences in the main devices’ nominal eﬃciencies. In fact, the overall energy processed by the
storage system is greater for the hydrogen-priority EMS strategy (7976 kWh versus that much less
energy processed by the battery-priority EMS strategy, only 5634 kWh), which is due to the much lower
energy share processed by the batteries (which present higher nominal eﬃciency) for a comparable
output power (4055 kWh versus 3746 kWh).
The trends of the results are aligned with similar trade-oﬀscenarios reported in the literature
between energy eﬃciency, LLP% and system utilization, depending on the prioritization of the hydrogen
or battery systems in the microgrid management [6,21].
7. Conclusions
Although the use of RES is growing in order to address decarbonization targets, the time
discontinuity of renewable resources demands electrical grids topologies and EMS that can assure the
demand with quality, security and reliability. In this sense, local distributed ESS oﬀers the possibility
Electronics 2020, 9, 698
22 of 27
to temporarily decouple production and demand, providing versatility and ﬂexibility in the operation
of the renewable electrical grids.
With this goal in mind, this paper has presented an EMS functioning under two diﬀerent strategies:
hydrogen-priority vs battery-priority. The goal is to compare the results obtained when the priority is
to maximize the hydrogen systems’ utilization with the results obtained when the priority is to increase
the battery bank use. In both cases, the EMS pursues the best operation of the hybrid renewable
microgrid, implementing a selective power balance based on the control of the microgrid in the
long-term operation. The aim of the comparison between the two strategies is to analyze the long-term
behavior of the EMS in terms of the microgrid performance and eﬃcient energy use.
Under the hydrogen-priority strategy, a higher amount of energy (kWh) is stored in the form
of hydrogen, allowing a greater “energy inertia” in comparison to the batteries. On the other hand,
in the battery-priority strategy, the battery bank is used as primary energy backup, which presents
an increased round-trip eﬃciency; only when the bank battery SOC is not within the allowed range,
the hydrogen loop (electrolyzer and fuel cell) is used as a secondary backup.
By comparing both EMS strategies under the same simulation conditions, it has been veriﬁed
that the hydrogen-priority EMS strategy achieves lower LLP values (2% vs 6% for battery-priority
EMS strategy, ratio 1:3), thanks to the higher energy capacity respect to the battery storage (90 kWh vs.
40 kWh, ratio 2.25:1), which is due to the mass-energy density of the hydrogen as an energy vector,
providing more storage autonomy respect to the batteries. However, the global storage eﬃciency
decreases from 65.5% to 50.3%, due to the reduced share of battery energy, whose energy conversion
ratio is higher. In fact, the hydrogen-based systems process much more energy (7976 kWh against
5634 kWh when the battery-priority strategy is used) for a comparable output power (4055 kWh versus
3746 kWh), thus generating more losses.
In the reviewed literature, most works regarding hybrid renewable microgrids modelling are
based on battery-priority energy management strategies, focused on the short/medium-term operation.
Based on the results obtained and the analysis done, Table 7 shows the main ﬁnding of the
proposed paper in comparison with previous works. From here, it is possible to see there are not
been found scientiﬁc proposals where a comparative between hydrogen-priority vs. battery priority is
done in the long-term operation and that includes loss of load probability and global energy eﬃciency
analysis. Additionally, previous works also do not include a conservative use of the subsystems
(hysteresis operation) that allows the EMS strategy to prolong the life span of the equipment. From the
authors’ point of view, the main novelty of this paper is the demonstration that when the time window
is enlarged to a year, hydrogen-priority strategy guarantees better internal reliability, lower loss of load
and a minimal main power grid dependence respect to traditional battery-priority strategies.

Abstract 
Concentrating solar power (CSP) is one of the promising renewable energy technologies 
provided the fact that it is equipped with a cost-efficient storage system, thermal energy 
storage (TES). This solves the issue of intermittency of other renewable energy technologies 
and gives the advantage of achieving higher capacity factors and lower levelized costs of 
electricity (LCOE). This is the main reason why solar tower power plants (STPP) with molten 
salts and integrated TES are considered one of the most promising CSP technologies in the 
short term [1]. On the other hand, solar photovoltaic (PV) is a technology whose costs have 
been decreasing and are expected to continue doing so thus providing competitive LCOE 
values, but with relatively low capacity factors as electrical storage systems remain not cost-
effective. Combining advantages and eliminating drawbacks of both technologies (CSP and 
PV), Hybridized PV-CSP power plants can be deemed as a competitive economic solution to 
offer firm output power when CSP is operated smartly so that its load is regulated in 
response to the PV output. Indeed previous works, have identified that it would allow 
achieving lower LCOEs than stand-alone CSP plants by means of allowing it to better utilize 
the solar field for storing energy during the daytime while PV is used [1].  
On the fossil-based generation side, the gas turbine combined cycle (CCGT) occupies an 
outstanding position among power generation technologies. This is due to the fact that it is 
considered the most efficient fossil fuel-to-electricity converter, in addition to the maturity of 
such technology, high flexibility, and the generally low LCOE, which is largely dominated by 
fuel cost and varies depending on the natural gas price at a specific location. Obviously, the 
main drawback is the generated carbon emissions. In countries rich in natural gas resources 
and with vast potential for renewable energies implementation, such as the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE), abandoning a low LCOE technology with competitively low emissions – 
compared to coal or oil - and heading to costly pure renewable generation, seems like an 
aggressive plan. Therefore, hybridizing CCGT with renewable generation can be considered 
an attractive option for reducing emissions at reasonable costs. This is the case of the UAE 
with vast resources of both natural gas and solar energy.  
Previous work have shown the advantages of hybrid PV-CCGT and hybrid PV-CSP plants 
separately [1][2]. In this thesis, CSP and the two hybrid systems are compared on the basis 
of LCOE and CO2 emissions for a same firm-power capacity factor when considering a 
location in the UAE. The results are compared against each other to highlight the benefits of 
each technology from both environmental and economic standpoints and provide 
recommendations for future work in the field. 
The techno-economic analysis of CSP (STPP with TES), PV-CSP(STPP with TES) and PV-
CCGT power plants have been performed by DYESOPT, an in-house tool developed in 
Page 2 
 
 
 
KTH, which runs techno-economic performance evaluation of power plants through multi-
objective optimization for specific locations[1]. For this thesis, a convenient location in the 
UAE was chosen for simulating the performance of the plants. The UAE is endowed by the 
seventh-largest proven natural gas reserves and average to high global horizontal irradiation 
(GHI) and direct normal irradiation (DNI) values all year round, values considered to be lower 
than other countries in the MENA region due to its high aerosol concentrations and sand 
storms. The plants were designed to provide firm power in two cases, first as baseload, and 
second as intermediate load of 15 hours from 6:00 until 21:00. The hours of production were 
selected based on a typical average daily load profile. 
CSP and PV-CSP model previously developed by [3][1] were used. Ideally in the PV-CSP 
model, during daytime hours the PV generation is used for electricity production, covering the 
desired load, while CSP is used partly for electricity production and the rest for storing energy 
in the TES. Energy in the TES system is then used to supply firm power during both periods 
of low Irradiance and night hours or according to need. 
A PV-CCGT model has been developed which operates simultaneously, prioritizing the 
availability of PV while the CCGT fulfils the remaining requirement. There is a minimum 
loading for the CCGT plant which is determined by the minimum possible partial loading of 
the gas turbine restricted by the emission constraints. Accordingly, in some cases during 
operation PV is chosen to be curtailed due to this limitation.   
The main results of the techno-economic analysis are concluded in the comparative analysis 
of the 3 proposed power plant configurations, where the PV-CCGT plant is the most 
economic with minimum LCOE of 86 USD/MWh, yet, the least preferable option in terms of 
carbon emissions. CSP and PV-CSP provided higher LCOE, while the PV-CSP plant 
configuration met the same capacity factor with 11% reduction in LCOE, compared to CSP.

1. Introduction 
The total electricity demand of the globe is rising every year, which is directly reflected in the 
generation capacities installed. According to EIA report, world electricity generation is 
projected to reach 36.5 trillion kWh by the year 2040, from 21.6 trillion kWh in 2012, 
representing an increase of 69%[4]. The energy mix of 2012 as shown in figure 1, dominated 
by fossil fuels, representing 67% of the total generation followed by renewable energy 
(including hydro) with 29% and nuclear with 12%. The evolution of this energy mix is in the 
favor of increasing renewable energy (RE) penetration in the mix, on comparing the energy 
mix of 2012 to that in 2040, the increase in RE penetration is obvious to be of about 32%[4]. 
According to the COP21 the scenario targeted is well below 2⁰C which accounts for huge 
investments in power generation sector in RE [5]. 
There are many reasons for developing these technologies and increasing the clean energy 
percentage in the energy mix of the country. It depends on the location resources, energy 
dependency, climate change, opportunity cost, pollution, depletion of fossil fuel resources, 
and many other reasons.

At the early development stage of renewable energy technologies entering the energy mix 
and the development of these technologies, governments had to subsidize and create 
policies in favor of the development of such technologies. Nowadays there are some 
technologies that are already feasible without any subsidies from the government and 
provide better feasibility than fossil fuel fired technologies.  
In this study, the renewable resource of concern is Solar Energy. Solar Energy is the most 
abundant resource on earth, which is harnessed directly through solar radiation, and 
indirectly through other forms as wind, hydro (rain), and biomass [6]. As well as fossil fuels as 
of oil, natural gas, coal, and wood are all formed by photosynthesis, which is a result of solar 
energy. The Earth atmosphere intercepts 1.75 x 105 TW, out of which 1.05 x 105 TW reaches 
the earth’s surface, considering 60% transmittance. The irradiance on 1% of the earth’s 
surface could provide a resource base of 105 TW through a conversion efficiency of only 
10% [7]. For the time being, the technologies that allow harnessing solar energy are basically 
2 technologies: Solar photovoltaics (PV) and Solar thermal power, including low and high 
temperature applications, such as domestic solar water heaters and concentrating solar 
power (CSP) generation, respectively.  
Concentrating solar power (CSP) is one of the promising renewable energy technologies 
provided the fact that it is equipped with a cost-efficient storage system, thermal energy 
storage (TES). This solves the issue of intermittency of other renewable energy 
technologies and gives the advantage of achieving higher capacity factors and lower 
levelized costs of electricity (LCOE). This is the main reason why solar tower power plants 
(STPP) with molten salts and integrated TES are considered one of the most promising 
CSP technologies in the short term[8]. On the other hand, solar photovoltaic (PV) is a 
technology whose costs have been decreasing and are expected to continue doing so 
thus providing competitive LCOE values, but with relatively low capacity factors as 
electrical storage systems remain not cost-effective. Combining advantages and 
eliminating drawbacks of both technologies (CSP and PV), Hybridized CSP-PV power 
plants can be deemed as a competitive economic solution to offer firm output power when 
CSP is operated smartly so that its load is regulated in response to the PV output. Indeed 
previous works by the authors have identified that it would allow achieving lower LCOEs 
than stand-alone CSP plants by means of allowing it to better utilize the solar field for 
storing energy during the daytime while PV is used. [9] 
On the fossil-based generation side, the gas turbine combined cycle (CCGT) occupies an 
outstanding position among power generation technologies. This is due to the fact that it is 
considered the most efficient fossil fuel-to-electricity converter reaching 60% for the 
advanced cycles, in addition to the maturity of such technology, high flexibility, the 
generally low LCOE, which is largely dominated by fuel cost and varies depending on the 
natural gas price at a specific location. Obviously, the main drawback is the generated 
carbon emissions. [10] 
In this study, power generation cycles involving the previously mentioned technologies 
CSP, PV and CCGT will be analyzed thoroughly in terms of theory of operation, 
 
 
Page 15 
 
modelling, plant design, dynamic performance and feasibility study. A comparative 
analysis will be performed afterwards, highlighting the pros and cons of each technology 
from a technical and economic perspective. 
The Middle East is a very interesting region to be considered, when it comes to renewable 
energy and fossil fuel resources. According to the World Energy Resources report 2013 
issued by the World Energy Council, This region is endowed with 41% of the world’s 
natural gas proved reserves and 48.1% of the world oil proved reserves [11]. In terms of 
renewable resources, the most significant resource is solar energy as the Middle East and 
North Africa lies in the Sun-belt region [12]. The United Arab Emirates will be considered 
the case study for this work where the previously mentioned technologies are heavily 
used (CCGT), or of high potential as (PV and CSP). This study considers actual market 
perspectives and current tender conditions. 
1.1. Previous work 
There have been many previous research work about simulation and optimization of PV-
CSP power plants, which comes to one part of this thesis; While the uniqueness of this work 
is in the benchmarking of optimized CSP, PV-CSP plant with optimized hybrid PV-CCGT 
plant, for the UAE.

POWER PLANTS, by James Spelling and Björn Laumert, 2015 
This paper compares 3 different configurations of hybridized combined cycles with 
gas turbine (CCGT), which are: Solar PV with combined cycle (SPVCC), 
Integrated solar with combined cycle (ISCC), where the heat energy from the solar 
field is input to the steam cycle, and finally the Hybrid gas turbine combined cycle 
(HGTCC), where the heat from the solar field is input to the compressed air in the 
gas turbine. The comparisons are based on technical and economic performance 
of the 3 configurations at different solar share. Two analyses were performed; the 
first considers the conservative technical limits of the power plants equipment, 
while the second considers the maximum feasible limits. Both analyses were 
focused on the performance of the plants at different annual solar share. Energy 
system modelling was utilized in this study and not power plant modelling, where 
fewer details are considered. 
 
In comparison to the work of this thesis, No comparison was performed with PV-
CSP hybrid plants, no power plant optimizations were performed to obtain the 
optimum power plant for each technology, and finally the study was based on 
energy system modelling, so detailed power plant design and dynamic 
performance were not considered in this study.

HYBRID PHOTOVOLTAIC POWER PLANTS: LEAST COST POWER OPTION 
FOR THE MENA REGION, by Christian Beyer and J. Reib, 2010 
 
This study analyzed the performance of hybrid plants based on 24 different 
configurations of the following technologies: PV, wind, CCGT, CCGT with CCS, 
conventional coal, coal with CCS and renewable power methane (producing 
hydrogen from RE and then combining hydrogen with Carbon dioxide to produce 
methane).  No optimization was performed in this study, and the hybridized plant 
that would be relevant is the PV-Wind-CCGT, which is still different than what is 
discussed in this thesis. 
 
 
 
Many efforts were exerted within the KTH solar research group in developing CSP 
and PV-CSP hybrid plants, which will be utilized in this study to be benchmarked 
with the PV-CCGT model at a specific unprecedented location. 
1.2. Objective of the Study 
The objective of this work is to study the competitiveness of CSP and PV-CSP hybrid power 
plants in utility scale application for power generation purposes and to compare it to 
hybridized combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) with PV. This study is to be carried out for a 
location in the MENA region, designated, the UAE. In order to carry out this comparative 
analysis, a techno-economic analysis is to be done for each of the mentioned technologies 
(CSP, PV-CSP and PV-CCGT) and to identify the optimum configuration of each technology 
then compare the techno-economic indicators of each technology considering that technical 
requirements are met and that the comparison between the three plants is consistent. 
A breakdown structure of this objective could be summarized in the following points: 
 
Developing a model of the PV-CCGT, in terms of dynamic performance and 
financial model. 
 
Creating the needed data for a new location (UAE), such as weather data, 
technologies cost related data, and financial related data….etc. 
 
Customizing the existing CSP and PV-CSP models on the new location.   
 
Running multi objective optimizations (MOO) for each of the technologies to obtain 
the optimum plant configuration of each technology. 
 
Performing comparative analysis between the results of each of the MOOs. 
1.3. Methodology 
The techno-economic analysis of CSP, PV-CSP and PV-CCGT power plants will be 
performed by DYESOPT, an in-house tool developed in KTH, which runs techno-economic 
performance evaluation of power plants through multi-objective optimization for specific 
locations. For this study, the UAE was chosen for simulating the performance of the plants.  
 
 
Page 17 
 
CSP and PV-CSP models (previously developed by the Solar research group in KTH) were 
customized to the location selected, while a PV-CCGT model has been newly developed for 
the sake of this study. A multi objective optimization is performed for the 3 models to obtain 
the optimum plant configuration for each technology; afterwards a comparative analysis was 
performed. Finally, sensitivity analyses were performed to account for the possible variations 
of some technical and economic factors, the results are again discussed and a final 
conclusion is drawn with the possible opportunities of the studied technologies for the UAE 
and possibly countries in the MENA with similar conditions. 
2. Technologies involved in this work  
In this section, the different technologies involved in this study will be briefly explained in 
terms of different types, theory of operation, and some other aspects. These technologies 
are used in many applications such as electricity generation, desalination, process heat, and 
solar fuels[13]. The technologies are considered for utility scale electricity generation 
application (MW scale per unit). 
2.1. Concentrating Solar Power 
This technology operates on direct sunlight, which is direct beam radiation that is not 
deviated by clouds and aerosols in the atmosphere and reaches the earth’s surface as 
parallel beams for concentration [12]. The DNI quality is more important for CSP than other 
solar technologies as PV and CPV, as a CSP plant parasitic consumption and thermal losses 
are constant, accordingly below a certain level of DNI the net output of the plant is zero [14]. 
In order for CSP plants to function properly and be economically viable, the DNI of the 
location should be at least 2000 kWh per square meter per annum [15].  
The concept of this technology is based on using mirrors for concentrating direct normal 
radiation (beam radiation) on a receiver, reaching a temperature range of 400 °C to 1000 °C 
[12]. The higher the concentration ratio, the higher the receiver temperature and eventually 
the higher temperature achieved by the power cycle.  The receiver is cooled down and the 
heat energy gained is transferred by means of a heat transfer fluid (HTF). The heat is then 
utilized for running a Rankine cycle, generating electricity. In some cases, thermal storage 
facilities are added where the thermal energy from the HTF is stored during the availability of 
excess energy or off-load hours. There are different types of commercial CSP technologies 
that have been developed for MW-utility scale electricity generation. Mainly, there are four 
main types: Parabolic troughs and linear Fresnel systems, which are line-concentrating 
shown in figure 2, and central receivers (Solar Tower) and Parabolic dishes (with Stirling 
engines), which are point-concentrating shown in figure 3 [14].

Figure 2. Parabolic Trough and Linear Fresnel System, line concentrating types[12] 
        
 
Figure 3. Central Receiver and Parabolic Dish, point-concentrating types [12] 
Parabolic dishes will be excluded from this study as it is not convenient for utility scale 
generation(in terms of generation per unit)[13] and there is no commercial storage solution 
yet available, and accordingly it will not make sense to compare it to the other 3 technologies 
in this study. A brief description with advantages and disadvantages of each type (excluding 
Parabolic dish), will be explained in the following sub-section. 
2.1.1. 
Types of CSP technologies 
2.1.1.1. Parabolic Trough 
Parabolic Trough technology is the most mature CSP technology available in the market and 
ranked the first among other CSP technologies in terms of installed capacities. It consists of 
loops of parabolic trough-shaped mirrors tracking the Sun on a single axis. These mirrors 
concentrate the direct normal radiation onto a thermally efficient receiver tube with a factor of 
60 – 80 [16], where a HTF (usually oil) flow through. The fluid is heated up to 390°C [14] and 
pumped to a conventional Rankine cycle. The heat from the HTF is exchanged through 
economizers, evaporators and superheaters to produce superheated steam out of saturated 
water, and generates electricity through a steam turbine generator. Parabolic trough systems 
 
 
Page 19 
 
could be hybridized with a combined cycle and thermal storage facilities could be added as 
well. Parabolic Trough systems are characterized by a proven annual 14% overall efficiency, 
being modular, and has a good land-use factor. The main disadvantage so far is the HTF as 
oils is used which limits the operating temperature to only 400°C and the fact that it is 
flammable [13].   
2.1.1.2. Linear Fresnel Systems 
Linear Fresnel systems are similar to the Parabolic trough systems, but a series of long flat 
or slightly curved mirrors are used instead of the parabolic trough-shaped ones. These long 
mirrors are set at different angles at each side of the receiver, which is located at a higher 
elevation of several meters above the mirror plane. The mirrors concentrate the sunlight onto 
the receiver with a factor of about 60. Unlike the parabolic mirrors, in the Fresnel collectors 
the focal line is somewhat distorted, accordingly a mirror is required above the receiver 
acting as a secondary reflector to refocus the rays missing the receiver. A wider receiver 
might be used, which consists of multiple tubes that are wide enough to receive all the 
reflected rays. The operating temperature of this technology reaches 350°C [15]. The main 
advantages of this technology are low cost and high land-use efficiency, while the 
disadvantages are low operating temperatures and only small projects of this technology are 
operating [13]. 
2.1.1.3. Solar Tower Power Plants (Central Receiver) 
Solar Tower technology is a point-concentrating type where large mirrors with tracking 
(Heliostats) are used to focus sunlight on a central receiver on a top of a tower, with a 
concentration factor of 600 – 1000 [17]. Through this central receiver, a HTF circulates to 
extract the heat energy gained from the highly concentrated radiations by the heliostats to 
generate superheated steam in a conventional steam cycle and generate electricity through 
a steam turbine generator. The HTF could be water/steam, molten salts, liquid sodium and 
air. High temperatures are achieved by this technology, reaching 1000 °C when air is used 
as a HTF[13]. In case of using air as a HTF the solar field is integrated with a gas turbine, or 
a combined cycle with a topping gas turbine. This technology is characterized with high 
conversion efficiencies and integration with storage and storing energy at high temperature. 
2.1.2. 
CSP Technologies market overview 
According to CSP today 2014 Solar tower report[18], solar tower technology is expected to 
play an important role in terms of capacity share and market activity. As detected by “CSP 
today” global tracker (July 2016), the data in table 1 shows that parabolic trough technology 
is by far the top in terms of “capacities in operation” and “construction”, yet, solar tower 
technology, represents more than 65% of total capacities in planning and development 
Page 20 
 
 
 
phases [19]. This means that the eyes of the industry are highly focused on this technology, 
in addition to the claims that this technology is the most viable route towards grid-parity.

On hold, unconfirmed) 
Another study showing the results in figure 4, where solar tower technology (CR) has the 
lowest LCOE, compared to PT and LF. Fresnel technology is the cheapest in terms of 
investments but the production is quite low compared to CR and PT which is obvious from 
the capacity factor indicator, that is why it resulted in the highest LCOE [20].

2.1.3. 
CSP technology of choice 
From this stand point, the solar tower technology was chosen to be the technology of choice 
in this study, among the CSP available technologies. Thermal storage facility will be included 
in the selected model for lowering the LCOE and achieving dispatchability, accordingly direct 
steam generation model of power plants is excluded, and finally the chosen model is solar 
tower system with molten salts as HTF, thermal storage facility of 2 tanks with molten salts 
(the most proven technology) and a conventional steam cycle as a power block. 
2.1.4. 
CSP in details with focus on Solar Tower technology 
As shown in figure 5, there are 3 main blocks that build the solar tower power plant: Solar 
field, Thermal Energy Storage block (TES), and the Power Block. The solar field is the block 
 
 
Page 21 
 
harnessing thermal energy from solar radiations and transferring it to the HTF (Molten salts 
in this case), the TES block is where the excess thermal energy stored in molten salt tanks 
and discharged according to requirements, and finally the power block where the heat 
energy is converted to electricity through exchanging heat with the power cycle (water/steam 
in this case) and electricity is generated through a steam turbine generator. In the following 
section a brief description will be explained for each key component of the plant. 
 
Figure 5. the three main blocks of a solar tower power plant[18] 
2.1.4.1. Solar Field 
The solar field (SF) is the most CapEx intensive block in the CSP plant, the 2 main 
components of this block are the Heliostats and the receiver. 
2.1.4.1.1 
Heliostats 
Heliostats are an essential component in the STPP, and the most expensive component in 
the cost structure of this technology. Heliostats are dual-axis tracking mirrors, reflecting DNI 
onto the central tower receiver located 100 to 1000 meters away. Mirrors on heliostats are 
almost flat; a slight curvature is required for better focus. Normally, large heliostats consists 
of smaller mirrors assembled on a substrate backing as shown in figure 6, the concave 
surface is formed by tilting the smaller mirrors toward a point on the receiver, so that the focal 
length of the heliostat is the distance between the receiver and the furthest heliostat [18]. 
There are no standard dimensions of heliostats, their sizes vary in a range from 1 m2 to 160 
m2[14]. Different designs of solar fields are possible where the heliostats are arranged in 
different patterns taking into consideration shading, blocking, and attenuation at further 
distances from the central tower. 
Page 22 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Back view of a Heliostat unit[18] 
2.1.4.1.2 
Receiver 
The receiver is placed over a tower in order to receive the reflected radiations more 
efficiently. Towers are usually made with steel structure or concrete, through analysis it is 
proven that at heights below 120 m steel is more economic and more than 120 m, concrete 
is less costly. Receivers could be classified to external and cavity receivers, external 
receivers are formed of vertical pipes welded together forming a cylindrical shape where the 
HTF passes through those tubes to heated to the desirable temperature, while the cavity 
type serves for reducing the convective losses from the receiver where the absorbing 
surfaces are located inside cavities at the top of the tower. The two types are shown in figure 
7 (a) and (b) respectively.

2.1.4.1.3 
Solar Multiple 
The solar multiple is defined as the ratio between the solar field thermal power at design 
point to the power block thermal power at nominal conditions, as shown in equation (1), 
where 𝑄̇𝑆𝐹,𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙 is the thermal power from the solar field while 𝑄̇𝑃𝐵,𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙 is the thermal 
power required by the power block. It simply compares the solar field size to that of the 
power block, in terms of thermal power.[21] This parameter ranges between 1.1 and 1.5 
(reaches 2 for Linear Fresnel Reflector) for plants without thermal energy storage, while 
those with thermal storage may have a value from almost 3 to 5.[17] This parameter is 
always higher than 1 in order to achieve the power block nominal conditions for a longer 
interval. As shown in figure 8 the difference in terms of “nominal performance interval” is 
quite clear between 2 plants of SM 1 and 1.5, on the other hand the spillage or the energy 
lost is much higher in case of the plant with SM of 1.5 (considering no TES). Plants with 
higher solar multiples have relatively higher LCOE due to the non-profitable solar field 
installed.[21]

2.1.4.2. Thermal Energy Storage (TES) 
The thermal energy storage technology utilized in this study is “Two-Tank Direct System”, 
which involves the fluid collecting solar energy to be the same as the one used for energy 
storage, which is molten salts in this case. The system comprises of two tanks at two 
different temperatures, low and high temperature. During charging, the fluid flows from the 
low temperature tank (cold tank) to the solar receiver, and then stored in the high 
temperature tank (hot tank). In hours with insufficient irradiance, discharge takes place where 
the fluid flows from the high temperature tank (hot tank) to the power block heat exchanger, 
generating steam, and stored afterwards in the low temperature tank (cold tank). [18] 
Page 24 
 
 
 
Integration with thermal Energy Storage (TES) is an advantage that makes CSP a favored 
option among other renewable energy technologies, where it provides an economic feasible 
solution for energy storage. The advantages are that it allows the plant dispatchability, which 
is the ability to provide electricity on demand [13], in addition to being decoupled from the 
availability and intermittency of the solar resource. In terms of short interval energy storage, it 
smooths out the electricity production as it works as a buffering reserve, while in long interval 
storage (several hours), the CSP plant could reach high capacity factors and follow the 
demand curve without any dependence on the solar input availability.[13] 
Figure 9 shows the output of different technologies, Photovoltaic and CSP with direct steam 
generation (DSG) does not incorporate any storage facility and accordingly those 
technologies follow the solar input, while in case of CSP with storage shown in green and 
yellow, firm power output and dispatchability are achieved.[22]  
 
Figure 9. Dispatchabilty of CSP with TES compared to other technologies[22] 
2.1.4.3. Power Block 
The power block in this application is basically a steam cycle, where the heat exchanger 
replaces the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) and the rest of the cycle is nearly the 
exact same, where superheated steam is expanded in different turbine stages, with reheat in 
between, and steam bleeds for preheating the feedwater entering the heat exchanger. The 
difference lies in the special operation mode of such steam turbines, unlike normal combined 
cycle plants and Steam cycles were the steady operation at rated power is the common 
mode of operation, the steam cycle associated with the CSP plants requires more flexibility 
and higher efficiencies at partial loads as this is the normal mode of operation in this 
application[18]. 
 
 
Page 25 
 
2.2. Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels 
PV systems are basically solar modules that are commonly either c-Si (crystalline silicon) or 
of the thin-film type. Crystalline silicon materials incorporate monocrystalline and 
polycrystalline types, while thin film technology has many semiconductor materials including 
Cadmium Telluride (CdTe), Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS), and amorphous Silicon 
(a-Si). Thin film technology is always cheaper as the involved materials are less expensive to 
produce, and characterized by lower conversion efficiencies. Many thin-film materials have 
been introduced, yet the aggressive reduction in c-Si modules has vanquished the cost 
advantage of the thin-film technology[23]. The solar modules directly convert solar energy 
into electricity through Photo-Voltaic effect. Direct current electricity (DC) is produced which 
requires an extra component for conversion to alternating current electricity (AC), which is 
the inverter.  
In the last years, PV has reached an amount of annual installed capacities that is 
unprecedented. Many reasons are behind this achievement, but the most important is the 
rapid decline in solar module prices[23]. Further details about the technology, market, design 
and cost, could be found in [24], [25], [26], [27], and [28]. 
2.3. Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) 
The principle is based on integrating one or multiple gas turbines with a steam power plant 
where the heat source of the steam power plant is the cold source of the gas turbine(s). The 
heat from the exhaust gas of the gas turbine is recovered by means of heat recovery steam 
generator (HRSG), generating superheated steam for expansion in a condensing turbine. 
The output is the most efficient fossil fuel to electricity converter. Thermal efficiency exceeds 
55%, with the gas turbine providing two thirds of the total capacity and exhaust gases could 
be exceeding 550 C. The remaining third is provided by the steam turbine, which is fed by 
superheated steam at 85-100 bars and 510-540 C.[29]   
Combined cycles built in the 1990s and the early 2000s were typically designed for base 
load operation. Due to the increased contribution of non-dispatchable renewable energy 
generation and the overcapacity in a liberalized market, it became very important for 
combined cycles to operate at part load and be subjected to frequent load changes. Due to 
these factors, it is common for combined cycle power plants to be shutdown at night and 
during the weekends as the cost of energy production is less than the revenues in some 
markets. In addition, due to the high penetration of renewables in some regions, and 
intermittency being a nature of such kind of generation, grid reliability is compromised. 
Accordingly high flexibility, efficient partial load operation and reduced minimum operation 
load, became crucial features for combined cycles. Partial load operation is generally 
characterized by efficiency reduction relative to full load operation. It is generally due to the 
Page 26 
 
 
 
decrease in the gas turbine efficiency, which is accounted for the lower pressure ratio and 
firing temperature at partial load. Modular configurations of 2 gas turbines on 1 steam turbine 
improves the total gas turbines efficiency at partial loads, in addition to the operation at a 
lower minimum load, as the minimum load for operating 1 gas turbine is half the minimum 
load of operating both compared to the total power as one could be shutdown. [30] 
The technical minimum environmental load is a very important term that should be identified. 
It is defined as the minimum possible load that the gas turbine can operate on, keeping the 
NOx and CO emissions within the environmental limits. The minimum load of GT operation is 
more impacted by the NOx rather than the CO emissions.[31] 
 A lot of research and development is dedicated to reduce the minimum load of operation of 
a GT in order to be able to operate the GT at a wider range of loading, accordingly it is easier 
for the whole plant (CC) to follow the daily load profile variations and the intermittency of 
solar PV generation, in case of PV hybridization. According to a report issued by IEAGHG in 
June 2012 the technical minimum load of a gas turbine would range from 30% to 50% of full 
load of the gas turbine [31]. While another report issued by Alstom in 2011 describing the low 
load operation of the KA26 combined cycle, it was stated that the minimum load at which a 
combined cycle power plant (equipped with GT26  with sequential combustion)could operate, 
complying with emission limits could reach below 20 % [32]. 
Recent combined cycle power plants are well developed for meeting current market 
requirements in terms of fast response (ramping up and down), quick start up low load 
operation reaching 14% of plant base load while maintaining emissions constraints [33]. 
From [32] and [31], it was concluded that the operation of the GT at 10% of baseload is 
technically possible and accordingly this was the operation limit assumed in this study in 
order to allow maximum possible integration of PV and minimum curtailment. 
This flexibility comes with some drawbacks such as the low fuel efficiency during operation at 
part load, compared to that during base load operation, as well as higher rates of NOx and 
CO emissions. The good news is that the effect of renewable energy penetration overcome 
both of the formerly mentioned drawbacks.[34]  
Due to the increase in the rate of installed capacities of renewable energy generation added 
every year[34], OEMs tend to improve those functions by several initiatives, such as: 1) Full 
dispatchability between the HRSG and the Gas turbine, to allow the GT from ramping up 
without impacting the HRSG. 2) Several solutions for heat retention during shutdown to 
reduce heat losses during shutdown and achieve a quicker start. 3) Implement high degree 
of automated and reliable start-up for the plant. 4) Implement highly complex control systems 
capable of providing convenient ramp rates for each component according to its state.[35]

2.3.1. 
Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) 
The HRSG is a main component in a combined cycle (CC) which acts as a heat exchanger 
between the exhaust gases of the gas turbine and the saturated water fed by the feed-water 
pumps. The HRSG requires slow heating rates due to the thick walls of steam drums, while 
in case of once through HRSG (Benson-type), there are no steam drums, so no 
manifolds/containers with thick walls which allows quick start of the gas turbine and the once 
through HRSG is the recommended type for CC used in cyclic applications [35]. 
2.3.2. 
Steam turbine 
Another critical component in the CC , which received a great contribution of innovations and 
improvements to reduce the startup time as the ones mentioned above. These 
improvements allowed the CC to start  and respond much faster, specifically during hot starts 
and load-following mode [35].  Although higher configurations of combination of gas and 
steam turbines would allow lower operation load and higher efficiency, yet higher 
configurations might require a larger steam turbine which has a higher start-up time and the 
flexibility known for combined cycles might be harnessed and it will be more convenient for 
base load operation (large capacities). [35] 
2.4. Hybridization 
2.4.1. 
PV-CSP 
Operational hybridization of PV-CSP is the concern of many research studies and has been 
implemented recently in projects as Atacama-1 in Chile developed by Abengoa [36], and 
Copiapó in Chile as well, developed by SolarReserve [37] and others. The hybridization is 
based on the prioritization of the PV plant o/p whenever available, while the remaining 
capacity is complemented by the CSP plant which provides dispatchability for the whole 
complex due to the integration with a TES facility, and it can dispatch with response to the 
PV plant output. As shown from the plant layout in figure 10, the hybridization is performed 
on the operational level, where both plants together provide a specific required firm output by 
means of smart dispatch control. The main advantage of this hybridization is the reduction of 
the LCOE of the whole plant compared to only CSP, in addition to achieving higher CF for 
the same LCOE when compared to CSP alone. 
Page 28 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10. PV-CSP plant layout 
2.4.2. 
PV-CCGT 
The hybridization of PV-CCGT is performed on operational level as well, same as in the CSP 
case, whenever PV production is available, it is prioritized and the CCGT plant ramps down 
in order to accommodate the PV production, while the whole plant provides a required 
specific firm output by means of smart dispatch control. The PV-CCGT plant layout is shown 
in figure 11. The advantage of this hybridization is the reduction of carbon emissions 
generated from the CCGT, in addition to the reduction of OpEx, as less fuel is burnt with 
higher PV integration. This concept is not implemented yet, but it is analogous to having both 
technologies: PV and CCGT, as generators in a certain grid where the plants operation is 
managed on the grid level. PV capacities are recruited when available and Gas turbines as 
well as CCGT are recruited to cover the demand unmet by the renewable intermittent 
generators and the relatively fast response, especially for GT is the advantage that allows 
this functionality. 
The advantage of having the hybridization on the plant level is depicted in the simplification in 
control and providing the possibility of sharing electrical inter- connection lines and 
infrastructure in order to reduce costs.[2]

3. The MENA region  
Across the MENA region almost all the countries of the region are endowed with an average 
to high solar resource, as shown in figure 12, extracted from IRENA solar atlas [38], the GHI 
in the region reaches more than 2600 kWh/m2. In order to choose the location of this study, 
many factors have been considered in accordance with the technologies under study. The 
criteria of the chosen location was essentially the solar resource, natural gas resources 
(where the gas fired combined cycles will still be attractive), land resource (as CSP and PV 
require vast land areas), policies and legislations promoting renewable energy and carbon 
emissions abatement, previous similar successful projects and relevant future plans with 
regards to the technologies under study, and finally a stable political situation that stimulates 
flow of investments into such projects.  
Electricity demand has been rising in the MENA region between 6% and 8% as a mean 
average growth rate. Some power plants in the GCC countries experienced an increase in 
peak load with 12% comparing 2014 and 2015 summer loads. Baseline projections for the 
region show a total yearly energy consumption of 1000 TWh by the year 2020, from only 800 
in the year 2012. [39] 
Page 30 
 
 
 
 
Figure 12. MENA region solar map – HelioClim3 – GHI [38] 
4. Country of choice: UAE 
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) was the country of choice considering the above mentioned 
criteria. The country does not score highest in each criterion, but provides a general good 
compromise. The UAE consists of seven emirates: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras Al 
Khaimah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain and Fujairah, covering 83,600 km² of land area with a 
population of 8.45 million (2012), installed power capacity of 30 GW and electricity 
consumption of 87 TWh[40]. Abu-Dhabi and Dubai forms the core of the economy of the 
country[40], and the only emirates involved with renewable energy activities.  
4.1. Solar resource 
The solar resource is not the highest in the region yet it could be considered as an average. 
In 2010 the measurements showed DNI were ranging from 1900 to 2200 kWh/m2, while GHI 
measurements were ranging from 2100 to 2300 kWh/m2 across the country. As shown in 
both GHI and DNI solar maps in figure 13 (a and b), the Southern parts of the country have 
the highest irradiation, yet these regions are uninhabited, eventually no transmission lines 
exist there. The Northern parts have lower values, and the lowest is for the Northeastern 
coastal region where the concentration of airborne dust particles is at its highest and the 
humidity from the coast. The dust particles and humidity impact intensively the DNI values 
and this is obvious from figure 13 (a).[41]

Figure 13. DNI (a) and GHI (b) of the UAE in year 2010 [41] 
 
4.2. Natural gas resources 
The next criterion is the natural gas resource, where the UAE is considered one of the world 
largest hydrocarbon reserves holders and exporters. The UAE is ranked seventh in terms of 
natural gas reserves[11] with 6.1 trillion cubic meters[42]. In terms of production the UAE is 
ranked the 17th globally, producing 9.4 billion cubic feet per day. Despite the huge 
production, UAE is a net importer of natural gas due to the immense demand increase in 
electricity which is almost completely based on natural gas. The gas imports are from Qatar 
through the Dolphin gas export pipeline connecting Qatar and Oman through the UAE. 
[42][11][43][40]  
4.3. Previous and planned projects 
As mentioned earlier Dubai and Abu-Dhabi are the most important emirates in the UAE 
generally and specifically with regards to renewable energy activities. In this section it will be 
obvious that all renewable energy projects are taking place either in Dubai or Abu-Dhabi. 
Abu-Dhabi: 
SHAMS 1 is the first and only so far, CSP plant to be built in Abu-Dhabi. A 100 MW capacity 
using parabolic troughs technology hybridized with fossil-fired back-up, developed and 
owned  by Masdar, Abengoa and Total [40], [44]. In addition to the 10 MW solar PV plant 
installed as well, by Masdar city using multi-crystalline and thin film solar panels from 
Suntech and First Solar [45]. Abu-Dhabi is having its first big PV project in tendering phase, 
of a 350 MW capacity[39]. 
Page 32 
 
 
 
Dubai: 
Dubai’s biggest project is the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar park. Phase 1 of this 
project was only 13 MW and was inaugurated in October 2013, owned by DEWA and 
developed by First Solar [46].On the residential application side, Shams Dubai project was 
initiated to encourage residential installations of PV, and 4 MW of PV are installed on 
buildings’ rooftops. 
In terms of planned projects, the nearest is the 200 MW CSP power plant which is currently 
under tendering for advisory services [47], which will be operational by 2021 [48]. Another 2 
projects in the pipeline are: the phase 2 solar PV of 200 MW of the famous landmark PPA of 
5.85 US cents/kWh [39]developed by ACWA power to be operated in 2017 [49], and finally 
phase 3 of the 800 MW solar PV with the world record of 2.99 US cents/kWh awarded in 
June 2016 to a Masdar-led consortium including the Spanish companies FRV and GranSolar 
Group, the 800 MW plant should be operational by 2020 [50]. Mohammed bin Rashid Al 
Maktoum Solar park is planned to include a capacity of 1000 MW by 2020 and  5000 MW by 
2030, where the CSP technology will generate 1000 MW out of the 5000 MW by 2030 [48]. 
Dubai future plans represents a solar contribution of its energy mix of 25 % by 2030, and 
renewable contribution to be 7% by 2020, 25% by 2030 and 75% by 2050, while Abu-
Dhabi’s official clean energy target is still 7% by 2020 [39]. 
4.4. Land resource 
In terms of land resource, the total land area of the UAE is 83,600 Km2, of which mainland 
represents 77,700 Km2[51] compared to other countries in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, 
Algeria, Egypt, Sudan and others, the UAE is much smaller. Yet the land utilization in the 
UAE is quite low, for example in Abu Dhabi, only 30 % of the land is inhabited [52], providing 
plenty of land areas for building power plants with such technologies that consume large land 
areas. 
 
4.5. Political and economic situation 
According to Coface risk assessment of the UAE, politically the country is considered as a 
safe-haven within the turmoil all over the region since 2011. The business climate is 
considered the most favorable in the region. Economically, due to the diverse economies of 
international trade, air transport, tourism, and financial services that contributes up to 44.5% 
of GDP [53], the country  was able to be resilient against the drop in hydrocarbons prices 
started in 2015 [54]. However, this declination in oil revenues created a budget deficit, which 
is expected to remain in 2016, but positively pushed the government into the direction of 
 
 
Page 33 
 
reform of energy subsidies [54]. Meanwhile the banking sector stays profitable, liquid and 
well capitalized [54]. Worth mentioning that the UAE was Ranked second, after Saudi Arabia 
in the EY Cleantech survey report MENA 2014, as the country with the highest potential for 
renewable energy investments within the next five years[55]. 
4.6. Case study 
In order to proceed with the UAE as a country for the case study a specific location should be 
selected, as the country consists of seven emirates, each with a dedicated electricity market 
operating at the emirate level [40]. Although Abu Dhabi was the early adopter and pioneer of 
the solar technology in the country through the SHAMS 1 plant, in this study, the emirate of 
Dubai was selected due to the clear announced solar energy related policies extending till 
the year 2030, with serious steps towards achieving the targets announced.  
4.6.1. 
Projected Energy mix 
The electrical power generation in Dubai is basically dominated by natural gas, where all 
power plants are gas fired of 9.7 GW installed capacity, 7.1 GW of which are gas turbines,  
2.5 GW of Steam turbines and a tiny 13 MW solar PV plant as the first phase of the famous 
solar park previously mentioned  [56]. A roadmap has been set by the supreme council of 
energy (DSCE) aiming for reducing the dependency on natural gas through penetration of 
7% clean coal, 7% Nuclear and 25 % solar by 2030, with the remaining 61% as natural gas 
as shown in figure 14 [57]. Most of the electricity generation power plants are desalination 
power plants as well, as the country lacks fresh water bodies and depend on fresh water 
wells and sea water desalination as a source of fresh water.  
 
Figure 14. Dubai projected energy mix by 2030 [57] 
4.6.2. 
Typical daily demand profile 
The typical daily demand profile of Dubai was concluded from two different profiles, as 
Dubai’s typical daily demand profile was not found through the literature review performed. 
Page 34 
 
 
 
The first profile is a typical daily demand profile of a prototypical MENA city with a typical 
demand pattern and a supply mix of open and combined-cycle turbines, shown in figure 15 
below that was used in a study performed by Pwc (Price Waterhouse and Cooper) and ESIA 
(Emirates Solar Industry Association)[58]. This profile shows a logical steady demand during 
the night, and a smooth rise starting at 6:00, and ramps faster at 9:00 creating a peak at 
12:00 and declines with the same rate to create another small peak at 18:00 and declines 
again till reaching an almost steady demand during the night. As obvious, those peaks are 
covered by gas turbines. Solar irradiance levels are perfectly matched with the major peak 
taking place at 12:00, which makes solar energy an optimum power generation solution for 
such case. 
 
Figure 15. A typical daily demand profile of a typical MENA city [58] 
The second profile is Abu-Dhabi’s typical daily demand profile for the year 2014 [59], shown 
in figure 16 below. During winter, the profile shows a minimum demand day with almost a 
firm demand with a slight rise starting at 4:00 and another rise at 17:00 lasting for about 4-5 
hours and then a declination till 4:00 again. The maximum demand variation along the day is 
about 20% and it is quite smooth without any spiking peaks. During summer and due to high 
temperatures and humidity the enormous cooling / Air-conditioning load doubles the capacity 
needed and create some minor deformations to the smooth typical winter day demand 
profile. At 6:00 - 7:00 the demand profile ramps up to +15% in about 3 hours and along the 
following 10 hours it remains steady with slight rise during the evening hours 14:00 to 20:00 
and finally declines during the night till 6:00. The maximum demand variation along the day is 
about 23% and still no significant peaking spikes. 
 
 
Page 35 
 
 
Figure 16. Abu-Dhabi 2014 minimum and maximum daily demand profiles[59] 
According to DEWA (Dubai Electricity and Water Authority) website, peak load hours are 
reported to be from 12:00 to 17:00 [60]. From the former mentioned profiles, the intermediate 
load (Between peak and base load) for Dubai was assumed to be of 15 hours, from 6:00 to 
21:00. 
4.6.3. 
Electricity and water market 
In the UAE electricity is always associated with water, this will be obvious in all the 
governmental entities mentioned in this section, all managing both electricity and water 
facilities. The electricity and water market was wholly owned by the government in Dubai, 
where Dubai owns and operates all Power generation and water desalination plants, 
transmission and distribution networks. Lately private sector participation was encouraged for 
the economy to continue growing and develop. Accordingly IWPP (Independent Water and 
Power Producer) model was implemented where a government regulator (Regulatory and 
Supervisory Bureau for Electricity and Water) license and regulate new entrants to assure 
that the services provided are safe, reliable and efficient. Another important government 
agency, is Dubai Supreme Council of Energy DSCE, which is the policy making body of the 
energy sector, develops strategies, provide governance, and create policy frame-works for 
Dubai’s energy sector assuring diversification of Dubai’s energy mix, promoting renewables 
penetration, and improving energy efficiency. [61][62][40] 
The electricity and water market structure in Dubai could be elaborated as shown in figure 
17. The Supreme council (represented by DSCE) develops the policy framework to the 
operator (represented by DEWA). The operator starts tendering for electricity generation and 
water desalination projects. Developers bid as IWPPs (Independent Water and Power 
Page 36 
 
 
 
Producers), IWPPs will be governed by power and water purchase agreements (PWPA) and 
other agreements related to ownership, financing, operations and maintenance, EPC, and 
land lease. Bids are based on minimum price proposed through long term PWPA. The off-
taker (also represented by DEWA), procures electricity/water from the IWPP based on the 
agreed upon PWPA. And finally transmission and distribution system operators (which also 
represented by DEWA) deliver electricity to customers, who pay DEWA their electricity and 
water bills according to the set tariffs. The DEWA transmission network is connected to the 
emirates national grid (ENG) of which DEWA owns 30%. The ENG is in turn connected to 
the GCC grid. All blocks (activities) colored in green are represented by DEWA, Government 
agencies in grey, IWPP in yellow/green as DEWA owns equity in the IWPP and finally the 
customers in orange.[61][40][62] 
 
Figure 17. Dubai Electricity and Water market structure 
4.6.4. 
Tariff schemes 
Electricity and water tariff schemes in Dubai are all in flat rates depending on the 
consumption per month, without any variations in peaking hours. This will be directly 
reflected on a simple, straight forward dispatch strategy.[63]  
4.6.5. 
Previous utility scale solar tenders in Dubai 
In 2012, the first phase of the “Mohammad Bin Radshid Al-Maktoum Solar Park” of a 13 MW 
(DC) capacity was awarded to First Solar as EPC. The project was implemented by DSCE, 
and is managed and operated by DEWA. O&M services was provided by First Solar as 
well.[64] 
In 2015, Shuaa 1 project, the second phase of the solar park, of 200 MW capacity. The 
tender was awarded to the Saudi ACWA power and the Spanish TSK on IPP model based 
on minimum PPA which was a world record at that time of 5.84 US cents/kW. The contract is 
 
 
Page 37 
 
PPA-BOT (Build, Operate, and transfer) for 25 years. Shuaa Energy 1 Company was formed 
as a special purpose vehicle (SPV), with DEWA as 51% stakeholder, and the remaining 49% 
for both ACWA and TSK. The plant will be operational by April 2017. [65][66]  
Recently, in June 2016 the awarding of the 3rd stage of the solar park with 800 MW capacity 
was announced. The project is an IPP model and the tender was based on minimum PPA 
provided. The awarding was to a Masdar-led consortium, including the Spanish FRV and 
GranSolar group, setting a new world record 2.99 US cents/kWh beating the previous record 
also achieved in Dubai in 2015 of 5.84 UScents/kWh. The plant is planned to be operational 
in 2020 [67] 
The latest tender so far is a CSP project of 200 MW in the “Mohammad Bin Radshid Al-
Maktoum Solar Park”. The tender is for advisory services and no further announcements are 
available. 
5. Modelling  
DYESOPT (Dynamic Energy System OPTimizer) is an energy system modelling tool that 
has been created in KTH and is being developed in the solar research department at KTH. 
This tool so far is based on Matlab and TRNSYS, where MATLAB is used for all calculations 
within the steady state design, while TRNSYS is utilized to handle the system transients and 
the dynamic annual simulation of the system. The modelling process goes on by exchanging 
outputs from one layer to the other as shown in the flow chart in figure 18.[1], [68], [69] 
 
Figure 18. DYESOPT flow chart[68] 
In order to elaborate in details how the flow of calculations works, each block of the above 
mentioned flow chart will be explained and then the interconnections, the system of 
equations and the flow of inputs and outputs (the process) will be explained in details. 
Page 38 
 
 
 
5.1. Steady state design 
In steady state design the different blocks of each power plant technology are designed 
according to specific design points that are input to the model by the user according to the 
case requirements. 
1. CSP-STTP model  
The CSP model could be broke down into 3 main blocks: Power Block, Solar Field, and 
Thermal Energy Storage (TES). 
Power block:  
The sequence of calculation for the whole CSP model starts from the power block. The 
steam side is calculated first according to the rated capacity of the CSP plant, which is 
represented by the rated capacity of the power block, through an iterative process, starting 
with an assumed steam mass flow rate and ending by checking the power output, till the 
design mass flow is reached. Through the assumption of the mass flow and the power output 
check, pressures, temperatures, enthalpies and fluid properties are calculated at each 
thermodynamic state, considering some input design parameters that are input by the user. 
Accordingly components are designed where efficiency and flow rates of turbines, heat 
transfer coefficients of steam train components, temperatures and pressures of the 
condenser…etc., are calculated. 
When temperatures, pressures, enthalpies and fluid properties at each thermodynamic state 
on the steam train are identified, it is possible to calculate the corresponding points on the 
heat transfer fluid (HTF) side. Similar to the steam cycle calculation, the HTF cycle is 
calculated through an iterative process, where the mass flow rate is assumed and check is 
done across heat balances on the superheater and the reheater. The calculation of the 
power block is based on previous work by Bergman et al, 2011, and Staine, 1995 [70], [71], 
while the design of HTF cycle is based on work by NREL, 2008 [72]. [1], [68]  
Solar field 
The HTF represents the link between the power block and the solar field. Now, the amount of 
heat energy needed for the power block is calculated, it will be used to solve the solar field. 
The algorithm for designing the solar field is based on that of DELSOL developed by 
Kistler[73], it is a hybrid method involving two other methods (handling performance based 
location and needed spacing to avoid shadowing): 1) Field growth method: At which the field 
area is evaluated and then the best place for a heliostat is selected, followed by the same 
process for the second best location, iteration is done till the required heat capacity is 
achieved. The field area is then divided into zones and the average performance of each 
zone is evaluated. 2) Optimal radial-stagger pattern method: At which the heliostats are 
 
 
Page 39 
 
placed in a radial-stagger pattern to make sure that radial distances and spacing between 
the heliostats are achieved to avoid any shadowing. A perfectly optimized pattern, doesn’t 
assure a perfectly performing field. Hybridizing both methods provides better results. [1], [68] 
Thermal Energy Storage 
After the design of the solar field and the power block, it is easy to calculate the storage by 
knowing the temperature of the HTF, the storage discharge time (size in hrs) (both from the 
default parameters), and the heat demand required (calculated previously from the power 
block and solar field). The density of the HTF is deduced through correlations with 
temperatures. The mass flow rate is deduced from the amount of heat required and the 
storage size. Using the mass flow rate, time and density, the volumes of the tanks are 
calculated. 
2. PV model 
The PV model is developed completely in matlab, even the plant output at each time step. 
First, the design parameters are input in the tool including the specifications of the PV 
module and the inverter and many other parameters as the system total capacity (Wp). Then 
the number of modules in series and the number of strings in parallel are calculated based 
on the max. allowable voltage (PV module specifications) and the max allowable current 
(inverter specification). The maximum and minimum values of voltage and current are 
identified at the hourly global irradiance and temperature values, considering their effects on 
the nominal values. 
After the number of panels is defined as well as the configuration of series and parallel 
panels, the power plant is considered sized. The next step is to simulate the performance of 
the plant during the whole year, which is done using TRNSYS in most of the DYESOPT 
blocks. In this case it is performed in Matlab and the result is a text file with the hourly values 
ready for import to TRNSYS for hybridization with other models. In order to get these values 
the solar position should be calculated in addition to the corresponding global irradiance on a 
tilted surface with the given tilt angle or other, depending on the tracking system selected. 
The final output of the system is identified before and after the inverter as DC and AC power 
considering the conversion efficiency of the inverter. Higher values of DC production is 
curtailed if it exceeds the rated power of the inverter. The final calculated hourly output power 
is then aggregated to define the annual power output of the plant.

3. CCGT model 
A brief explanation of the calculations flow of the CCGT model will be explained in this 
section.  Further details of the model could be found in [74] were the model was created. The 
steady state of the CCGT model is comprised of two separate models: Gas Turbine (GT) 
and Rankine Bottoming cycle. 
Gas Turbine 
First of all, inlet air conditions are identified through input parameters and a built-in fluid 
properties library, Afterwards the compressor efficiency is calculated through an iterative 
method where compressor polytropic efficiency, nominal compression ratio and air properties 
are used. Finally compressor exit air properties are calculated. Fuel properties are calculated 
in order to model the combustion process. The gas properties exiting the combustion 
chamber are calculated in order to define the conditions before the turbine.  
In the turbine section after the gas composition is identified and the thermodynamic 
properties of the gas exiting the combustion chamber is identified, the turbine inlet conditions 
should be calculated as the properties are different due to the cooling taking place in the 
turbine. So first of all the turbine cooling is calculated in terms of difference of cooling air 
enthalpy and then the turbine inlet temperature and other conditions are deduced.  
The turbine pressure ratio is calculated referenced to atmospheric pressure, followed by the 
turbine efficiency calculation in order to calculate the enthalpy of exhaust gas exiting the 
turbine and the rest of the thermodynamic conditions are concluded. Specific turbine and 
compressor power are calculated, as well as nominal mass flow rate according to the 
nominal plant (GT) output specified in the input parameters. Finally total net output power is 
calculated considering the mechanical and electrical efficiencies. 
Rankine Bottoming Cycle 
The steady state design of the dual pressure Rankine bottoming cycle starts with the design 
of the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), where the input to the HRSG is the exhaust 
gas from the turbine with the previously calculated conditions. Through the design of the 
thermodynamic status of all points on both sides (gas and steam), the inlet and exit of each 
of the steam train: economizers, evaporators and superheaters for low and high pressure are 
determined. Mass flow rate of steam is then calculated through energy balance on the 
evaporators of each pressure level. 
Following the design of the HRSG, that of the turbine is performed, where steam turbines’ 
efficiencies, enthalpies and other properties at inlet and outlet, and output power for each 
 
 
Page 41 
 
turbine, are calculated. Finally, condensing system is calculated, determining all parasitic 
loads in the cycle and accordingly the net output power is deduced. 
5.2. Hybridization and Dynamic Modelling 
1. PV-CSP 
Hybridization of PV with CSP is based on the prioritization of PV whenever available due to 
the absence of dispatchability for PV technology, while the CSP production variates to 
accommodate the PV production, in order to always maintain firm power output referenced to 
the Rankine cycle capacity of the CSP. Further details about the hybridization of PV-CSP, 
dispatch strategy and control system are available in [1], [69], [3]. 
2. PV-CCGT 
In this section the hybridization of the PV and CCGT will be explained. The hybridization is 
done on the dynamic layer of the plant (PV-CCGT), where the PV plant output is 
precalculated in Matlab for each time step and an input file (PV-CCGT load file) is written and 
prepared before the simulation of the plant dynamic performance is started. As shown in the 
flow chart in figure 19, the PV-CCGT load file specifies the GT set point (Enom), which is the 
capacity required by the GT at this time step, this value is calculated as the nominal output of 
the GT after subtracting the PV plant output at this specific time step. The GT net specific 
power output (enet) is calculated as the difference between the turbine and compressor 
specific power output (et) and consumption (ec), respectively. Using the net specific output 
power and the desired GT output at the specific time step, the desired mass flow rate could 
be calculated. This desired mass flow rate is fed to the compressor in order to obtain the 
desired GT output providing the total plant output when combined with the PV output. The 
calculated desired mass flow rate should lie in the range between Mmin and Mmax, which 
defines the minimum and maximum openings of the compressor guide vanes, this to assure 
that stall is avoided and max inlet air is not exceeded.

5.3. Techno-economic performance indicators 
In order to evaluate the power plants under study, key performance indicators representing 
the technical and economic performance of the plant will be explained in details in this 
section. 
Capacity factor (CF) 
The capacity factor is calculated as shown in equation (2), by dividing the plant electricity 
production, represented by the summation of plant power output at each time step “Pplant,t “ 
(1 hour is considered) along the year, over the plant nominal capacity “Pplant nom" multiplied 
by number of hours in a year. This term indicates how good is the utilization of the plant 
referenced to a plant operating every hour in the year at rated capacity. In case of 
considering a hybrid plant, PV-CSP or PV-CCGT plant,  Pplant,t is calculated as shown in 
equations (3), and (4), respectively. While Pplant nom is considered as the desired capacity of 
the plant calculated for each of the plants as shown in equations (5), and (6).

Levelized cost of Electricity (LCOE) 
The levelized cost of electricity is the main parameter assessing the economic performance 
of each technology in this study. LCOE simply gives the electricity production cost of a 
certain technology, so it is originally the cost of unit energy produced, normalized over the 
plant lifetime.  
As shown in equation (9), the approach adopted in calculating LCOE in this study is based 
on the work of [75] and it is represented as the net present value of all costs along the plant 
lifetime, divided by that of the electricity produced over the plant lifetime. It is worth 
mentioning that the discounting of the energy term is not an indication of any physical 
performance of the system, but it is due to the algebraic solution of the equation[76]. The 
associated costs along a plant lifetime considered in this calculation are: the total capital 
investment (𝑇𝐶𝐼), capital insurance cost (𝐶𝐴𝑃𝐸𝑋∗𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑠), decommissioning cost (𝐶𝑑𝑒𝑐) and 
operational cost (𝑂𝑃𝐸𝑋𝑡); while the total electricity production in each year is (𝐸𝑡). In order to 
get the NPV, cash flows should be discounted, where weighted average cost of capital 
(WACC) was used as a discount rate, considering the cost of debt and equity and their share 
in the CapEx.

Equation (10) shows the calculation of WACC where (𝐸𝑞%) is the equity share of CapEx  
(𝐷%) is the debt share of CapEx, (𝑖𝑒𝑞) is the cost of equity, ( 𝑖𝑑) is the cost of debt, and 
(𝑇𝑎𝑥𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑝.) is the corporate tax as the interest on debt is considered after tax (tax deductible) 
𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐶= 𝐸𝑞% ∗𝑖𝑒𝑞+ 𝐷% ∗𝑖𝑑∗(1 −𝑇𝑎𝑥𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑝.)  
 
 
 
 
(10) 
Total capital investment (𝑇𝐶𝐼), represents the real “up-front” capital requirement considering a 
special interest rate during construction phase, calculation details are found in [75]. 
The CapEx and OpEx terms are identified for each technology in the following section, where 
in case of hybridization these values are added to form the total CapEx or OpEx of the hybrid 
plant. Cost structure for each technology will be explained in this section. 
CSP plant cost structure 
The cost structure of the CSP plant is divided into CapEx and OpEx, the CapEx is as shown 
in equation (11) accounts for the direct and indirect costs. The direct costs (𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑃−𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡) 
accounts for the costs of: tower (𝐶𝑇𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟), receiver cost (𝐶𝑅𝑒𝑐), solar field (Heliostats) (𝐶𝑆𝐹), 
power   block (𝐶𝑃𝐵), thermal energy storage (𝐶𝑇𝐸𝑆), balance of plant (including all auxiliaries) 
Page 44 
 
 
 
(𝐶𝐵𝑂𝑃), site cost, including site preparation, civil work and evaporation ponds (𝐶𝑆𝑖𝑡𝑒), and 
finally contingency (𝐶𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡), s shown in equation (12). While the indirect cost comprises the 
costs of, engineering, procurement and construction (𝐶𝐸𝑃𝐶), land (𝐶𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑) and finally the sales 
tax (𝐶𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑇𝑎𝑥), as shown in equation (13). 
𝐶𝐴𝑃𝐸𝑋𝐶𝑆𝑃= 𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑃−𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡+ 𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑃−𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 
 
 
    (11) 
𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑃−𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡= 𝐶𝑇𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟+ 𝐶𝑅𝑒𝑐+ 𝐶𝑆𝐹+ 𝐶𝑃𝐵+ 𝐶𝑇𝐸𝑆+ 𝐶𝐵𝑂𝑃+ 𝐶𝑆𝑖𝑡𝑒+ 𝐶𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡 (12) 
𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑃−𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡= 𝐶𝐸𝑃𝐶+ 𝐶𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑+ 𝐶𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑇𝑎𝑥 
 
 
     (13) 
Regarding the CSP OpEx costs, as shown in equation (14), it consists of costs of: labor 
operating the plant (𝐶𝐿𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑟), contractual services costs (𝐶𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑠), Utilities which represents 
electricity for auxiliaries, water and fuel (𝐶𝑈𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠), miscellaneous costs accounting for 
operation overheads (𝐶𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑐.), and finally insurance costs (𝐶𝑖𝑛𝑠.).  
𝑂𝑃𝐸𝑋𝐶𝑆𝑃= 𝐶𝐿𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑟+ 𝐶𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑠+ 𝐶𝑈𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠+ 𝐶𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑐. + 𝐶𝑖𝑛𝑠.        (14) 
Values of all the above mentioned costs were scaled on reference plants data extracted from 
[18] and [40]. 
PV plant cost structure 
The cost structure of PV plant is as well divided into CapEx and OpEx. As shown in equation 
(15), the PV plant CapEx is comprised of direct and indirect costs. The direct costs are 
represented in the cost of the PV modules (𝐶𝑃𝑉 𝑚𝑜𝑑.), Inverters (𝐶𝐼𝑛𝑣), tracking system and 
structure (𝐶𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑘), Balance of system including cabling electrical connections and all other 
auxiliaries (𝐶𝐵𝑂𝑆), and contingency costs (𝐶𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡) as shown in equation (16). While the indirect 
costs comprises of the developer costs such as overheads, developer’s contingency, and 
other related costs excluding land  (𝐶𝐷𝑒𝑣), engineering and design, procurement, construction 
management and EPC profit (𝐶𝐸𝑃𝐶), land cost (𝐶𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑), and finally sales tax (𝐶𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑇𝑎𝑥), as 
shown in equation (17). 
𝐶𝐴𝑃𝐸𝑋𝑃𝑉= 𝐶𝑃𝑉−𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡+ 𝐶𝑃𝑉−𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡  
 
 
(15) 
𝐶𝑃𝑉−𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡= 𝐶𝑃𝑉 𝑚𝑜𝑑. + 𝐶𝐼𝑛𝑣+ 𝐶𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑘+ 𝐶𝐵𝑂𝑆+ 𝐶𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡 
(16) 
𝐶𝑃𝑉−𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡= 𝐶𝐷𝑒𝑣+ 𝐶𝐸𝑃𝐶+ 𝐶𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑+ 𝐶𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑇𝑎𝑥 
 
(17) 
The PV plant OpEx cost structure was much simple compared to the CSP plant, as shown in 
equation (18) the OpEx consists of basically two sections were the operations and 
maintenance contractual services (𝐶𝑂&𝑀) is one, and the insurance costs is the other (𝐶𝑖𝑛𝑠.). 
 
 
Page 45 
 
𝑂𝑃𝐸𝑋𝑃𝑉= 𝐶𝑂&𝑀+ 𝐶𝑖𝑛𝑠. 
 
(18) 
The PV plant costs were extracted from sources [77] and [78], figures from [78] were 
adjusted using correlations deduced from [18] to accommodate to location of study. 
CCGT plant cost structure 
A new cost structure was developed for the CCGT plant in this work. The cost structure is 
divided into CapEx and OpEx. The CapEx is basically extracted from [79] for a complete 
CCGT plant, through a capacity – cost correlation. The prices are in US dollars, incoterm 
considered is FOB (Free on Board) factory, so shipping, insurance and custom clearance are 
not included according to the rules from the Incoterms® 2010 edition. The prices quoted 
include EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) turnkey scope, including major 
equipment supply, plant engineering and construction.  
The CCGT plant accounted for, in this extracted cost is bare bones, NG (natural gas)-fired 
plant, with a basic conservative steam cycle and a basic HRSG without duct firing which is 
generally what was developed in the model. In order to make sure that the economic model 
matches the technical model further cost additions were considered, such as: utilization of 
air-cooled condenser instead of water cooled, which accounted for an extra 10% according 
to [79], water treatment and waste water systems costs accounted for an added 4% 
considering power block costs from [18]. Developer cost was extracted from [80] after 
comparisons with figures from [81] and [18]. Contingency cost was determined through 
considering figures from [82], [18], and [83].  
CapEx structure of CCGT plant could be summarized in equation (19), where the CCGT 
CapEx (𝐶𝐴𝑃𝐸𝑋𝐶𝐶𝐺𝑇) comprises of: total cost of plant (𝐶𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙) and indirect costs 
(𝐶𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡). The total cost of plant, as shown in equation (20), considers (𝐶𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡) representing 
the plant cost considering air-cooled condenser and including EPC, the water treatment and 
waste water systems cost (𝐶𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡.), and developer cost (𝐶𝐷𝑒𝑣.). Finally, indirect cost is 
basically the contingency cost (𝐶𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡) and sales tax (𝐶𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑇𝑎𝑥) as shown in equation (21). 
𝐶𝐴𝑃𝐸𝑋𝐶𝐶𝐺𝑇= 𝐶𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙+ 𝐶𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡

𝐶𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙= 𝐶𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡+ 𝐶𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡. + 𝐶𝐷𝑒𝑣. 
 
(20) 
𝐶𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡= 𝐶𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡+ 𝐶𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑇𝑎𝑥  
 
 
(21) 
The OpEx structure of CCGT plant is divided into maintenance and operation costs as 
shown in equation (22). Maintenance costs comprises of fixed and variable costs as shown 
in equation (23), where the fixed costs are always associated with the plant capacity and is 
independent on hours of operation or electricity production, on the other hand the variable 
Page 46 
 
 
 
costs are depending on the plant operation and electricity production. Operation costs 
comprises of fuel and water cost as shown in equation (24). 
𝑂𝑃𝐸𝑋𝐶𝐶𝐺𝑇= 𝐶𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑡+ 𝐶𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟

𝐶𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑡= 𝐶𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑑+ 𝐶𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 
 
 
 
 
(23) 
𝐶𝑂𝑝𝑒𝑟= 𝐶𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙+ 𝐶𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 
 
 
 
 
(24) 
Fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs were deduced based on extractions 
from [80], [81], [84], [85], and developed correlations between certain costs at different 
location based on data from [18]. Fuel (natural gas) and water costs were extracted from [86] 
for this location of study. 
6. Multi Objective Optimization 
Techno-economic analysis of power plants considers many conflicting objectives, as plants 
for example, might be required to produce maximum possible electricity (achieve high 
capacity factor), yet, at minimum costs, or if it is a hybrid plant involving fossil fuels, it might 
be required to have maximum renewable contribution yet, with minimum capital investments. 
There are several examples for such cases, but the common thing is that those objectives 
are conflicting in the majority of the cases. Accordingly, no single optimum could be obtained 
for all objectives, and for examining the trade-offs between different objectives, multi-
objective optimization (MOO) comes in handy.  
Using such optimizer provides the possibility of examining different trade-offs and helps 
decision makers to select the desired compromise between the objectives of concern. 
DYESOPT comprises a modified version of Queuing Multi-Objective Optimizer (QMOO)[9], 
[87], an evolutionary algorithm, which is a part of a wider class of routines known as 
population-based algorithms, which works in a way that it maintains a population of designs, 
set by resolution of the model, this population is moved towards a group of optimal designs 
through evolution[74]. This process ends with a development of a Pareto-optimal front, which 
is an optimal trade-off curve formed by several Pareto-optimal designs. These are designs 
which no other design exists that is simultaneously better in all objectives [87]. 
An example of Pareto optimal front is shown in figure 20, where the 2 objectives are favored 
at the two extreme, each on the expense of the other, and moving away from the Pareto 
front towards any other solution in the feasible region makes one objective worse, providing 
a “naïve” solution. [74] 
 
 
Page 47 
 
 
Figure 20. General example of a Pareto-optimal front [74] 
This optimizer has been developed at the Industrial Energy Systems Laboratory of the Swiss 
Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. [9], [74] 
6.1. Optimization Cases 
The location selected for this study is designated 24.3 N and 55.6 E, which is about 50 Km 
South the flagship project “Sheikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum Solar Park”. At this 
location, the weather data used was a Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) extracted from 
Meteonorm, a weather database which is considered the meteorological reference for solar 
energy and other applications.  
After the PV-CCGT model was implemented, the CSP and CSP-PV models were 
accommodated to the study case - in terms of weather data, cost functions, technical and 
economic input parameters -, cases were identified for running multi-objective optimizations, 
while variating critical design parameters, to obtain the optimum configuration of each 
technology based on two conflicting objectives.  
These objectives are maximizing the capacity factor (CF) which is an important technical 
KPI, and minimizing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) which is the most important 
economic KPI in the case under study. The two objectives are clearly conflicting in the case 
of CSP and PV-CSP power plants, where in order to obtain a higher capacity factor, a higher 
solar multiple (SM) is required, which leads to an increase in the size of the solar field. Larger 
storage facility is needed as well. Both are needed in order to cover the required capacity for 
a longer period. Consequently the plant CapEx increases significantly, which directly 
increase the LCOE. In PV-CSP, the impact of raising the CF is expected to be less than the 
CSP case, due to the fact that the PV contribution is basically a cheaper alternative instead 
of enlarging the solar field.  
Page 48 
 
 
 
The PV-CCGT case is different, as the desired capacity factor will be reached anyway 
through supplying more natural gas to the combined cycle to accommodate for the remaining 
capacity unmet by the PV part. The desired objectives in this case are maximizing the solar 
share and minimizing the LCOE, which are as well conflicting, as increasing the solar share 
means enlarging the solar part of the plant which is the more CapEx intensive and 
accordingly leads to a higher LCOE. 
The evaluation of each MOO for each technology will be thoroughly discussed and the 
optimum configurations obtained for each case will be evaluated against each other to 
provide a profound comparison of the 3 different power plant configurations/technologies for 
the selected location. As shown in table 2 and 3, two cases were identified for each power 
plant configuration (CSP, PV-CSP, and PV-CCGT) based on the dispatch strategy.  
The first case was for designing the plant for baseload operation, while variating the power 
plant capacity, in order to observe the power plant configurations at which the models tends 
to converge. As well as, how critical design parameters variate to achieve the two conflicting 
objectives, the trade-off between the two conflicting objectives, and the optimum capacity for 
each technology considering the 2 selected objectives. The design variables applied in the 
first case are mentioned below in table 2, with the ranges used for each variable for each 
technology.

The second case was for designing the plant for firm power output operation from 6:00 to 
21:00 following the typical daily load profile mentioned earlier. In this case, a fixed capacity 
for the power plant is set to 200 MW, as it is the capacity announced for the first CSP project 
in the flagship solar park in Dubai [48]. The objective of running this case is to identify the 
optimum configuration with the formerly specified capacity and with variating the selected 
critical design parameters, for each power plant and be able to have a consistent comparison 
between the three technologies under study. The design variables applied in the second 
case are mentioned below in table 3, with the ranges used for each variable for each 
technology.

Table 3. Design variables for optimizations of firm power 6:00 to 21:00 cases 
6.2. Results and discussion 
As mentioned formerly, two cases are studied for each of the three technologies (CSP, PV-
CSP and PVCCGT), accordingly six optimizations were performed. Three of which are 
considering baseload dispatch with variable plant capacity, the other three considers firm 
power output of 200 MW for 15 hours, 6:00 to 21:00. In this section, the results of those six 
optimizations will be presented, with an explanation for each case elaborating the trade-off 
between the selected objectives, the optimum plant selection, and the effect of varying the 
critical design parameters on the trade-offs. Each of the plots presented in this section is a 
result of more than 2000 evaluations which are represented as dots on the plots, each of 
which represents a specific plant configuration with a combination of the design variables 
mentioned in table 2 or 3. The optimum plants are the set of dots forming the Pareto front 
with each extreme favoring one of the objectives and the trade-off is at the curve bent; while 
the dots confined by this front are considered as naive solutions. 
6.2.1. 
CSP 
6.2.1.1. CSP baseload: 
In the following plots, the results of the optimizations run for CSP technology in baseload 
operation with variable capacities are shown. Objectives targeted are Maximum capacity 
factor and minimum LCOE, through variating some key parameters, shown in table 2. 
Different key parameters are shown as a third variable on the plots to compare their relation 
with the optimization results. The baseload optimizations were performed without fixing the 
capacities, in order to show the favored plant capacity according to the case-study. The 
results show a Pareto front with optimum plants ranging from 50% to 80% in CF, while LCOE 
values in a range from 145 to 180 USD/MWh. The relation of plant capacity with the 2 
mentioned objectives is shown in figure 21. The optimization converged to a range of plant 
capacities of 50 to about 175 MW. The trade-off region is clearly favoring a 100-130 MW 
plant capacity.       
Page 50 
 
 
 
 
Figure 21. CSP results in baseload operation – CSP capacity 
The relation of SM and TES size with the selected objectives are shown in figures 22 (a) and 
(b), respectively. High SM values and TES sizes will be needed in order to achieve high 
capacity factors which is clearly shown in figures 22 (a) and (b), this directly impacts the 
LCOE, but through optimizations plant capacity was compromised to achieve both high CF 
and low LCOE, resulting in optimum plants for highest CFs are of low capacities about 50 
MW as shown in figure 21.

The last plot for the results of this case is shown below representing the CapEx in figure 23. 
The CapEx of plants with solar multiple mentioned in the previous paragraph are shown as 
of a low range (light blue color), although these plants have a high SM and TES size, yet are 
of low capacities (around 50 MW) resulting in a relatively lower CapEx. While plants of the 
trade-off region where optimum plant “A” was selected are shown in orange to red color 
range, reflecting higher CapEx due to their larger capacities (100 to 130 MW).  
 
 
Page 51 
 
 
Figure 23. CSP results in baseload operation: CapEx 
Optimum plant “A” was selected for CSP technology in baseload operation. The choice was 
based on 2 criteria, the first is a 75% CF. This CF was chosen as it is the highest reasonable 
CF that could be achieved within this optimization, providing a fair trade-off between both 
selected objectives, almost center of the trade-off region. Minimum LCOE was the second 
criterion for identifying the plant. Plant “A” key parameters and performance indicators are 
mentioned in table 4. Further discussion will be presented in the “CSP optimum plants 
dynamic performance” section. 
6.2.1.2. CSP firm power 6-21 
The following plots show the results of CSP technology in firm power output operation from 
6:00 to 21:00 for a fixed plant capacity of 200 MW. The results plots elaborate the optimum 
plants designed in order to achieve minimum LCOE and maximum CF, through variating 
some key parameters, shown in table 3. The plots involve a third key parameter to be 
observed VS the two conflicting objectives. The results shows a clear Pareto front of CF 
ranging from 43% till 56% and LCOE ranging from around 160 to 250 USD/MWh. Higher 
capacity factors require higher SM and TES size as shown in figures 24 (a) and (b) 
respectively. As operating for more hours supplying firm output, requires a higher SM and 
larger storage capacities in order to generate during hours with low irradiance or night hours.

increases, which is clearly shown in figure 25, where the variation between low CF of 44% to 
high (relatively) 55% reflects an increase of more than 85% of the CapEx. As clearly shown 
as well, the CapEx increment per unit increase in CF, at high CF ranges is much higher than 
that in low CF ranges.

Optimum plant “B” was selected from the Pareto front of this optimization case. The selection 
was based on a CF of 53.1, representing 85% of the theoretical maximum CF of the case 
under study. The specific 85% choice, will be explained in the selection of the optimum plant 
of PVCCGT 6:00 to 21:00 case.  Minimum LCOE was the second criterion identifying the 
optimum plant for this case. Plant B lies in the trade-off region compromising both objectives 
(minimum LCOE and maximum CF). Plant “B” key parameters and performance indicators 
are mentioned in table 4. Further discussion will be presented in the following section (CSP 
optimum plants dynamic performance). 
6.2.1.3. CSP optimum plants dynamic performance 
In this section the two CSP optimum plants selected for each dispatch strategy will be 
discussed in deeper details through the key parameters and the dynamic performance 
through a plot of a 1 week operation. This section does not provide a comparison between 
the mentioned plants, as each provide a different dispatch strategy. The week selected 
shows a significant variation of solar resource, and accordingly provides a clear performance 
of the model at its extremes. This week will be fixed in all further dynamic performance plots 
for the sake of comparative analysis in following sections. Table 4 shows the key design 
parameters of the plants under study in both dispatch strategies. As mentioned earlier these 
plants are not the absolute optimum plants for this technology in this case study, but these 
are of the optimum plants selected from the Pareto front of the optimizations performed.

Table 4. CSP optimum plants parameters and key figures 
Figure 26 shows the dynamic performance of plant A, a CSP plant in baseload operation. 
The plant is a CSP-only plant of 113 MW capacity and a 16 hours storage facility (TES), the 
plant is equipped with a solar field comprising of 21804 Heliostats with a single tower 266 m 
high, resulting in a SM of 3.9. The 1 year performance simulation resulted in a CF of 75%, 
with an electricity production of about 743 GWhe.  
The dynamic performance shows the perfect operation of the plant (CSP power plotted in 
blue) in the first day, due to the availability of good DNI reflected in the field power plot 
colored in yellow and the partially charged TES. As shown the TES level (plotted with the 
black dotted line) drops during the discharge at night (when the field power is not available), 
then the plant shuts down due to the empty storage and irradiation unavailability. On the next 
day (Monday), the available DNI is sufficient to partially charge the TES and operate the 
plant for only few hours during the night. Due to bad DNI and empty TES, the plant remains 
in shutdown for 2 consecutive days. In the 5th day the plant operate for only few hours for 
same reasons, and finally the 2 remaining days provides an example of how the plant should 
be working in normal conditions. A good DNI is available to fully charge the TES, and 
operate the plant during the day, then the fully charged TES, keeps the plant running during 
the night till the next day, which comes in average DNI that partially recharges the TES and 
full load operation is sustained for 2 consecutive days. Finally, the thermo-economic 
calculations resulted in a total plant CapEx of about 800 milUSD, OpEx of 12.5 milUSD and 
an LCOE of 152.5 USD/MWhe.

Figure 26. Plant A - CSP baseload operation winter week 
Figure 27 shows the dynamic performance of plant B, a CSP plant in 6:00 to 21:00 of firm 
power operation. The plant is a pure CSP plant of 200 MW capacity, which will be fixed in all 
other optimum plants in firm power operation (6:00 to 21:00) for further comparative analysis. 
The plant includes a 24 hour storage facility (TES), and equipped with a solar field 
comprising of 32290 Heliostats with a single tower 280 m high, resulting in a SM of 3.23. The 
1 year performance simulation resulted in a CF of 53.1 %, with an electricity production of 
about 930 GWhe.  
The same week of baseload operation was chosen for showing the performance in the firm 
power operation, which is quite similar to that of baseload, except for the daily shutdown and 
start-up of the plant. The week starts with the same 2 days with good DNI, but in this case 
the 6:00 to 21:00 firm power was achieved without interruptions, extended to the third day 
despite of poor DNI, mitigated by the SM and the storage capacity. The 4th and the 5th day 
operation was interrupted due to empty storage and very poor DNI, and then restored again 
with improving DNI. 
Finally, the thermo-economic calculations after simulating 1 year of operation, resulted in a 
total plant CapEx of about 1268 milUSD, OpEx of 19.5 milUSD and an LCOE of 193 
USD/MWhe.

6.2.2.1. PV-CSP baseload: “C” & “C*” 
The plots in this section show the result of optimization of PV-CSP technology in baseload 
operation without fixing the plant capacity. The objectives set for this optimization were the 
same as that in the CSP, maximum capacity factor and minimum LCOE, while variating 
some key parameters, shown in table 2. The results show a clear Pareto front of optimum 
plants covering a CF ranging from 65% up to almost 93%, versus LCOE ranging from about 
150 to about 290 USD/MWh. The optimization converged to plants with CSP plant capacities 
in the range of 100 to 170 MW, which could be seen clearly in the trade-off region in figure 
28 (a), while smaller plants were favored for a slight increase in capacity factor, but those 
small plants are complemented with a larger PV plant capacity reaching to 4 times as big as 
the CSP as shown in figure 28 (b). Capacity ratio PV/CSP goes back from 4 to an optimum 
of 0.75 to 1 in the trade-off region.

Figure 29 (a) and (b), clearly explain how such high capacity factor is reached from a solar 
based technology. Larger solar field coupled with large storage capacities provide 
dispatchability to this technology, accordingly in both figures, CF higher than 85% are 
dominated with orange to red color, elaborating a SM range from 3 to 4 and a storage 
capacity ranging from 16 to 24. This could be easily explained as higher SM are needed in 
order to provide excess energy for charging a larger storage that would allow the operation of 
the plant during the night or hours with weak DNI.

The relation of CapEx with the two conflicting objectives chosen is shown in figure 30, where 
the variation across the whole Pareto front, only ranges from 900 to 1300 milUSD. The CSP 
plant capacity and solar multiple are 2 parameters that have a significant impact on the total 
plant CapEx. A certain balance is sustained in this optimization that resulted in this small 
variation in CapEx, larger capacities were chosen with low CF, the higher the CF the smaller 
the CSP capacity gets, till the trade-off and then higher contribution of PV is provided with 
 
 
Page 57 
 
smaller CSP capacities, which results in lower CapEx as PV replaces a significant part from 
the SF for less cost. 
 
Figure 30. . PV-CSP results in baseload operation: CapEx 
The optimum plant chosen in this case was plant “C”, which was easily chosen at an 
estimated trade-off point clearly distinguishable in this optimization, providing a perfect 
compromise between maximum CF and minimum LCOE. Another optimum plant “C*”, was 
selected in this case, for the sake of comparison with the corresponding CSP optimization, 
where the exact LCOE value achieved by the plant is used in this optimization result to 
choose the maximum CF achieved at this LCOE, proving the case that hybridization with PV 
provides higher CF for the same LCOE, or in other words: “contributes in lowering the overall 
plant LCOE”. Plants “C” and “C*” key parameters and performance indicators are mentioned 
in table 5. Further discussion will be presented in the (PV-CSP optimum plants dynamic 
performance) section. 
6.2.2.2. PV-CSP firm power 6-21: “D” 
In this section, the results obtained from the optimization run of PV-CSP model in firm power 
production dispatch strategy, with a CSP capacity of 200 MW, while variating some key 
parameters shown in table 3. The results show a clear Pareto front, quite similar to that of the 
baseload. CF ranges from about 42% to about 58%, versus LCOE range of around 160 to 
300 USD/MWh.  Figure 31 (a) shows the CapEx values of the plotted pants, in order to 
achieve higher CFs for a certain capacity, higher initial investments are needed, which 
directly impact the LCOE, specially on the top section of the Pareto front, where the 
investments are much higher than the benefit of the corresponding increase in CF. Figure 31 
(b) shows capacity ratio of PV/CSP,  where it is clear that for optimum plants, the ratio would 
be in the range from 0.5 to 0.9, favoring high PV contribution for high CFs.

The CapEx plot in figure 31 (a), could be clearly explained from the below plots in figure 32 
(a) and (b). As high CF are associated with higher SM and TES size as explained in the 
cases of CSP, this is directly reflected on the plant CapEx as the solar field is the most 
CapEx intensive part of the CSP plant.

The plot in figure 33 shows the curtailed PV for each of the plants involved in the CF-LCOE 
relation. It could be observed that plants achieving high CF, are characterized with high 
curtailment of PV production, which results in higher LCOE as well, due to the fact that 
CapEx spent on high PV capacities installed does not return in an equivalent higher 
electricity production.

Optimum plant “D” was selected from the Pareto front of this optimization case. The selection 
was based on a CF of 53.1, representing 85% of the theoretical maximum CF of the case 
under study. The specific 85% choice, will be explained in the selection of the optimum plant 
of PVCCGT 6:00 to 21:00 case.  Minimum LCOE was the second criterion identifying the 
optimum plant for this case. Plant B lies in the trade-off region compromising both objectives 
(minimum LCOE and maximum CF). Plant “D” key parameters and performance indicators 
are mentioned in table 5. Further discussion will be presented in the following section (PV-
CSP optimum plants dynamic performance). 
6.2.2.3. PV-CSP optimum plants dynamic performance 
In this section the two PV-CSP optimum plants (C & D), selected for each dispatch strategy 
will be discussed in deeper details through the key parameters and the dynamic performance 
through a plot of a 1 week operation. Plant C* is presented for sake of comparison with pure 
CSP plant A. This section does not provide a comparison between the mentioned plants (of 
the same technology), as each provide a different dispatch strategy. As mentioned in the 
CSP results section, the week selected is the exact same of the previous 2 cases for the 
sake of comparative analysis in following sections. Table 5 shows the key design parameters 
of the plants under study in both dispatch strategies.

Table 5. PV-CSP optimum plants parameters and key figures 
Figure 34 shows the dynamic performance of plant C, a PV-CSP plant operating as 
baseload, of a 122 MW CSP plant associated with a TES of 24 hours and a SM of 3.98 
capacity, hybridized with 104 MW(AC) of PV with single-axis tracking. The 1 year 
performance simulation resulted in a CF of 90%, with an electricity production of about 965 
GWhe. The figure shows the performance of the hybridized plant, with the same legend used 
as the CSP plots, adding the Net Electrical Power and the PV in red and green, respectively.  
The PV is prioritized whenever available to provide the needed production, while the CSP 
plant provide the rest, in addition to charging the TES for night hours production, The first 2 
days operated perfectly with the TES almost fully charged at the beginning of each day, while 
on the third day, the DNI was quite low, that the TES provided the needed capacity through 
almost the whole duration, while the PV contributed with a minor capacity as shown in the 
plot, with the CSP creating the trough in blue, accommodating the PV crest in green to 
assure firm output of 122 MW. The thermo-economic calculations resulted in a total CapEx 
of 912 milUSD, OpEx of 13.7 milUSD, and an LCOE of 169.07 USD/MWhe.

Figure 35 shows the dynamic performance of plant D, a PV-CSP plant operating from 6:00 to 
21:00 providing firm power, of a 200 MW CSP plant associated with a TES of 11 hours and a 
SM of 1.97, hybridized with 155 MWac of PV with single-axis tracking. The 1 year 
performance simulation resulted in a CF of 53.1%, with an electricity production of about 930 
GWhe. The figure shows the performance of the hybridized plant, with the same legend used 
in the PV-CSP baseload plot in figure 34.  
The dynamic performance is very similar to that of the baseload, except for the case of 
operating within a window (6:00 to 21:00). It is obvious for this plant configuration, a smaller 
TES and SM compared to the baseload case, as less hours are need to be covered, yet still 
not enough for covering the load during consecutive days with bad DNI. The thermo-
economic calculations resulted in a total CapEx of 764 milUSD, OpEx of 13.4 milUSD, and 
an LCOE of 174 USD/MWhe.

Figure 35. Plant D - PV-CSP 6:00 to 21:00 operation winter week 
Plant C* was selected from the baseload optimization Pareto front with the same LCOE as 
plant A (CSP), in order to compare both technologies in terms of CF reached for a certain 
LCOE. As shown, for the LCOE of 152 USD/MWhe, CSP optimum plant reached a CF of 
75%, while that of the PV-CSP reached a CF of 80%. In other words, hybridization of CSP 
with PV reduces the plant LCOE. This will be reassured through comparison of firm output 
plants of the same CSP capacity and CF, to provide a more solid evidence.

6.2.3.1. PV-CCGT baseload “E” 
The following set of figures show the optimizations of PV-CCGT technology in baseload 
operation strategy. The trade-offs between maximizing solar share and minimizing LCOE, 
considering a critical design variable or a key figure/KPI as a third variable on the plot. The 
results are based on the developed model in baseload dispatch strategy, while varying the 
design parameters in table 2, without fixing the CCGT plant capacity. As shown in all plots 
(36 till 38) the model tends to converge to a well clear and defined Pareto front, with 
minimum solar share and minimum LCOE at one side, maximum solar share with maximum 
LCOE at the other, and the trade-off between minimum LCOE and maximum solar share at 
the top left corner, where the optimum plant was selected.  
Figure 36(a) shows the CCGT capacity as a third variable on the plot. As the plant capacity 
was not fixed, the optimization converged to large CCGT capacities for achieving lower

LCOE as  economies of scale is quite significant in CCGT technology, this is clearly 
observed as well from the cost correlation at which the cost structure of this technology is 
based in this model, formerly mentioned. On the other hand, smaller capacities of CCGT 
plants were used with higher solar shares and higher LCOE. Figure 36(b), shows the PV 
installed capacity as a ratio of the CCGT capacity as the third variable, where it is clear that 
for achieving higher solar shares larger PV capacities will be required which will result in 
higher LCOEs and more expensive power plants. As mentioned in the hybridization section 
the PV max. output is limited by the CCGT nominal capacity for producing firm output and 
the excess is curtailed. Accordingly the only way to maximize the solar share is to add much 
larger capacities compared to that of the CCGT (higher PV/CCGT capacity ratio) in order to 
reach the needed firm output earlier in the day. This will result in larger curtailed PV output, 
which is considered as low utilization of the plant and reflects higher LCOE. This is clearly 
obvious from figure 36 (c), as minimal curtailment is achieved with PV/CCGT capacity ratio 
(ranging from 0 to about 1), reaching solar share of about 29%, and in order to increase 4-
5% more, the PV capacity should jump from 1 to 2.5 times the CCGT capacity.

Larger PV capacities require higher investments (CapEx), as shown in figure 37 (a).  The 
trade-off region shows the highest CapEx region, as it has medium-large (350 MW - 450 
MW) sized CCGT plants and a unity PV/CCGT capacity ratio, which means large PV plants 
as well. As shown in figure 37(b), the plant specific cost converges to about 1000 USD/kWe 
when it goes to the extreme of the lowest LCOE/solar share represented by almost pure and 
large CCGT plant, while it converges to about 1800 USD/kWe when it goes to the other 
extreme of maximum solar share/LCOE, which is represented by a configuration dominated 
by PV. In the optimum plants section, it will be elaborated that a large size CCGT specific 
cost is around 1000 USD/kWe, while the PV specific cost is around 1800 USD/kWe, which 
perfectly matches the above configurations. These values are based on the cost structure 
assumed in this study.

The main reason behind the hybridization of CCGT with PV goes back to the reduction of 
natural gas consumption to reduce OpEx and carbon emissions, which is straight forward, 
the higher the solar share the less operational expenses and less emission as shown in 38 
(a) and (b), respectively.

The gas turbine minimum operation load factor was set as a variable, and almost all the 
optimum plants converged to around 10%, which is the minimum value of this parameter. 
This is due to the fact that the lower minimum operation load factor provides better 
hybridization with PV, which will result in higher utilization of PV production, less curtailment, 
better LCOE and higher solar share. 
Plant “E” was chosen as an optimum plant for PV-CCGT technology in baseload operation. 
The choice was based on having a trade-off between the 2 objectives, where a solar share of 
about 29% centers this region. Multiple plants achieve this solar share, in order to have a 
precise choice, another factor had to be decided, which was the minimum PV curtailment, it 
reflects lower LCOE as well. Plant “E” key parameter and performance indicators are 
mentioned in table 6. Further discussion will be presented in the “PV-CCGT optimum plants 
dynamic performance” section. 
6.2.3.2. PV-CCGT firm power 6:00-21:00 “F” 
In this section, optimization results of PV-CCGT technology in firm power production from 
6:00 to 21:00, with a fixed CCGT capacity of 200 MWe, will be discussed thoroughly. The 
objectives targeted in this optimization are maximum solar share and minimum LCOE, while 
variating some key parameters, shown in table 3. The results obtained are similar as 
expected, to that of baseload operation with some interesting differences. The LCOE range 
in the 6:00 to 21:00 operation is higher than that of the baseload operation. This could be 
explained as better utilization is achieved during baseload for the same CapEx invested, in 
other words, higher electricity yield for same capital investment, which directly reflects lower 
LCOE. Another difference would be the higher solar share, exceeding 50% achieved in the 
6:00 to 21:00 operation. This could be explained by the fact that the 6:00 to 21:00 operation, 
involves a higher percentage of sunny hours to total hours of operation, than from 0:00 to 
24:00 (baseload operation). Accordingly if the same exact plant configuration was operated 
in both dispatch strategies, the solar share will be definitely higher in the 6:00 to 21:00 
operation. 
The CapEx relation with solar share and LCOE is the exact same as in the baseload case, 
as shown in figure 39 (a), where higher solar share requires larger PV installed capacities, as 
shown in figure 39 (b) increasing the solar share from 0%to 41% requires having a PV 
capacity ranging from 0 to 0.8 times the CCGT capacity, while increasing the solar share an 
extra 10%, requires double the capacity needed for the first 40%. Consequently, the end 
result is higher CapEx and LCOE. Higher solar shares will involve higher curtailment as well, 
due to the same reason mentioned in the baseload case, and as shown in figure 39(c).

The carbon emissions reduction is directly proportional to solar share, higher solar share 
results in higher emissions reduction, which is clearly seen in figure 40 (a). The same relation 
should be applied on operational expenses, the higher the solar share, the less fuel is 
consumed by the CCGT and accordingly less OpEx. Interestingly enough, this is not the 
relation obtained. As shown in figure 40(b), the result is the absolute contrary of what 
expected, the increase in solar share is directly proportional with the OpEx, which means that 
the hybridization of CCGT with PV, increases the overall OpEx of the plant. It comes off for 
the extreme of high solar share and high LCOE, where doubling the capacity for PV for an 
increase of less than 10% of the solar share does not pay-off compared to the corresponding 
reduction of fuel consumed. While the only explanation for the other extreme of the Pareto 
front (minimum solar share / minimum LCOE) is that the OpEx associated with the addition 
of solar capacity is higher than the reduction of OpEx resulting on the CCGT side.

Figure 40. PV-CCGT results in firm power 6:00-21:00 operation: (a) CO2 emissions (b) OpEx 
Figure 41 (a) shows the variation of the capacity factor, with increasing the solar share. The 
plot shows a reduction of the capacity factor with increasing solar share, as mentioned earlier 
the expected performance was that the capacity factor would be fixed to a value close to that 
corresponding to the needed operating hours. In this case, 6:00 to 21:00 would account for a 
CF of 62.5%. The configurations with zero solar share shows a capacity factor of about 55%, 
which is considered reasonable after accounting for daily starting and shutdown time, in 
addition to the plant availability. Yet, the CF goes down to nearly 51% with higher solar 
shares. This is coherent to the result shown in figure 41(b), where the net fuel efficiency 
drops to 35% from a 48% on a solar share range of 0% to slightly more than 50%.  
This could be explained by a model limitation, where the PV production is predefined at each 
time step, before the dynamic simulation of the power plant, as explained earlier, and 
according to the PV production the needed Output from the GT is dictated and fed to the GT 
as the nominal capacity at this time step. Upon which the GT ramps down to be replaced by 
PV production, and the opposite happens when the PV production start declining. The 
hybridization of the CCGT and the PV takes place between the PV and the GT, while the ST 
follows the result of the GT ramping up or down, while the PV production replaces that of the 
GT and not the ST, and excess production is clipped, at which the max. production of the PV 
is limited by the capacity of the GT excluding the min, load of operation. That is why there is 
a drop in the total power O/P of the plant during PV production.  
 Another reason for the low performance of the model is due to temperature, where high 
ambient temperature affects two main parts of the CCGT. The first part is the condenser 
which rejects the heat from the cycle to the ambient, and in dry cooled condenser this 
process involves cooling down with ambient air. Accordingly higher temperature will reduce 
the temperature difference and accordingly the rate of heat rejection, which directly impacts 
the overall efficiency of the cycle. The second part affected is the Gas turbine. Air density 
decreases with high temperature, affecting the air mass intake of the compressor and the 
Page 68 
 
 
 
overall performance of the GT.  This performance deterioration will be clearly elaborated in 
the comparative analysis section.

Figure 41. PV-CCGT results in firm power 6:00-21:00 operation: (a) Capacity factor (b) Net Fuel Efficiency 
Plant “F” was chosen as an optimum plant for PV-CCGT technology in firm power 6:00 to 
21:00 operation. The choice was based on a CF of 53.1%, which is 85% of the maximum 
theoretical CF (62.5%) of the firm power case. This CF was targeted, as it gives a 
compromise between solar share, capacity factor and net fuel efficiency, which was 
concluded after a thorough study of the optimum plants generated by this optimization. 
Multiple plants achieve this CF, in order to have a precise choice, another factor had to be 
decided, which was the maximum solar share for this CF. Plant “F” key parameter and 
performance indicators are mentioned in table 6. Further discussion will be presented in the 
following section (PV-CCGT optimum plants dynamic performance). 
6.2.3.3. PV-CCGT optimum plants dynamic performance: 
In this section the PV-CCGT optimum plants selected for each dispatch strategy will be 
discussed in deeper details considering their key parameters and dynamic performance of a 
1 week operation. The same week used for the analysis of CSP and PV-CSP technologies is 
fixed for PV-CCGT plants analysis, as it provides a significant variation of solar resource, and 
in order to perform a comparative analysis on same bases. Table 6 shows the key design 
parameters of the plants under study in both dispatch strategies. As mentioned earlier these 
plants are not the absolute optimum plants for this technology in this case study, but these 
are of the optimum plants selected from the Pareto front of the optimizations performed.

Table 6. PV-CCGT optimum plants parameters and key figures 
Figure 42 shows the dynamic performance of plant E, a PV-CCGT plant in baseload 
operation. The plant is of 396 MW capacity and hybridized with a 399 MW PV plant, with a 
minimum loading of 10% of the GT load. The 1 year performance simulation resulted in a CF 
of 90%, with an electricity production of about 3132 GWhe.  
The dynamic performance shows the operation of the plant, with the net electrical output, LP 
turbine output, HP turbine output, PV power, and net GT output, represented in green, red, 
blue, yellow and black lines respectively. It is clearly shown that the PV availability dictates 
the operation of the plant, as according to the PV output the desired load from the GT is 
defined, with the only constrain in the contribution of the PV is limited to the minimum loading 
of the GT. Periodic troughs are observed in the net electrical output, these troughs are 
created during the same duration of PV contribution. This defect has been explained in the 
reasoning behind low CF. In this section, it will be better elaborated through the plot in figure 
42. As shown, the trough on the green line, represents the drop in the output of both the LP 
and HP of the steam turbine in the CCGT, as the PV production should account for this drop 
before any curtailment takes place, while still the GT min. load is respected. It could be 
clearly seen that the troughs in the net electrical output has the exact same shape of the HP 
and LP troughs summed together.

Figure 42. Plant E - PV-CCGT baseload winter week 
The second issue mentioned in the results section affecting the overall CF of the plant could 
be explained if the output plot of figure 43 is compared to that in figure 42, it is the exact 
same power plant but in a different week, a summer week. The net electrical output is lower 
than that achieved during a winter week. This is due to the impact of high temperature, as 
explained in the results section, where the output of the whole CCGT is affected, as the heat 
rejection from air-cooled condenser is less effective at high temperatures when the 
temperature difference becomes smaller. On the other hand, the gas turbine air mass intake 
is affected due to high temperature as mentioned earlier in the results section. Finally, the 
thermo-economic calculations resulted in a total CapEx of 1317 milUSD, OpEx of 57 
milUSD, and an LCOE of 73 USD/MWhe.

7. Comparative analysis 
In this section the 3 optimum plants B, D and F, chosen from the 3 technologies CSP, PV-
CSP and PV-CCGT, respectively, will be compared against each other. As shown in table 7, 
the 3 plants are of fixed capacity of 200 MWe, serving a firm power output of 15 hours from 
6:00 to 21:00. The 3 plants achieve a CF of 53.1%.  Plants B and D provide a 100% 
renewable, clean generation while plant F is a hybridized plant, incorporating fossil fuel and 
eventually carbon emissions.  
 On comparing plants B (CSP) and plant D (PV-CSP) a significant reduction in SM and TES 
size, where the SM is reduced by about 40%, while the TES is reduced by 54%. This 
reduction is the result of the hybridization of the 200 MW CSP plant with a 155 MWac PV 
plant. The PV plant significantly contributed to the desired generation during the day while 
the CSP plant provided the rest, and charged the storage tanks which serves the load night 
hours or those with poor irradiance. This hybridization resulted in a much smaller solar field – 
which is the most CapEx intensive block in the CSP plant - and storage.

This resulted in lower CapEx, OpEx and consequently LCOE, where the PV-CSP technology 
provided 11% reduction in LCOE for same capacity factor. Comparing the two B and D to F, 
plant F provides the minimum LCOE due to the relatively low CapEx and very low NG price 
of 1 USD/MMBtu. That is on the expense of generating annual emissions of 341 thousand 
tons per year. Higher curtailment of PV is observed compared to the PV-CSP plant.

8. Sensitivity analysis 
In this section two sensitivity analyses have been performed on the PV-CCGT model, 
specifically plant “F”. The sensitivities are on natural gas price and carbon taxation. 
8.1. Natural gas price 
A couple of optimizations were performed with a higher natural gas price, while keeping all 
other design parameters exactly the same. The natural gas price used in the main 
optimization was the actual cost of fuel in the UAE as mentioned earlier 1 USD/MMBtu[86], 
which is much lower than the market price. The natural gas price used in the second 
optimization is the actual market price which is  2.79 USD/MMBtu[88], resulting in the 
relation shown in figure 45 (a), while that used in the third optimization was 8 
USD/MMBtu[88], which was a peak reached early in 2014, resulting in the relation shown in 
figure 45 (b). The results shown validates the explanation mentioned in the results and 
discussion section for figure 40, as by using higher fuel prices (without changing PV OpEx 
figures) the effect is clear that the OpEx relation starts changing and responds with an 
overall reduction in plant OpEx with higher solar share, as clearly shown in figure 36 (b) 
with the high natural gas price.

Table 7. Natural gas price sensitivity - PV-CCGT 6:00 to 21:00 firm power 
This sensitivity analysis shows clearly the impact of considering the actual market price in 
comparing the competitiveness of renewable energy solutions with fossil fired ones in 
Countries rich in NG resources, where the cost of NG production is quite low. It is clearly 
Page 76 
 
 
 
shown as well that the increase in natural gas market price will lead to competitiveness 
improvement for CSP related solutions, as shown in table 8, LCOE of the exact same CCGT 
plant and solar share rises from 86 to 136 USD/MWhe, when comparing with the latest price 
peak reached since 2014. 
8.2. Carbon Tax 
The second sensitivity performed on the same exact model and design variables at NG price 
of 1 USD/MMBtu, while only variating CO2 tax. In order to simulate the impact on LCOE if 
carbon tax policy is implemented in the UAE, two cases were adopted, the UK and Chile. 
According to [89], The UK’s carbon price floor (CPF) is a tax applied on fossil fuels used to 
generate electricity. It was implemented in April 2013. In Chile, it is a part of legislation 
enforced in 2014, where measurements of carbon dioxide emissions from utility scale fossil 
fired plants will start in 2017, while the tax implementation should start in 2018 on the power 
sector. The impact of the two adopted policies of the UK and Chile are shown on the plot in 
figure 46, with the red triangle and green circle, respectively. The plot shows a directly 
proportional, linear relation between LCOE and carbon tax, as all other parameters are kept 
constant. 
 
Figure 46. Carbon Tax sensitivity and impact on LCOE 
The impact of implementing a carbon tax is obvious from table 9, where the LCOE has risen 
with about 8%, considering the extreme case (UK).

Carbon emissions calculated in this model represents CO2 emissions only and not other 
emissions as NOx, while the tax is applied per ton CO2 equivalent. Accordingly a precise 
calculation for the emissions generated from NG consumed will reflect higher LCOE.

9. Conclusion 
The objective of this work was to study the competitiveness of CSP and PV-CSP 
technologies in the MENA region and benchmark it with hybridized PV-CCGT considering 
current tender conditions and market perspectives. Accordingly, techno-economic models 
have been developed for this objective; optimization cases were prepared in ordered to 
identify the optimum configuration for each of the studied technology while maintaining a 
fixed capacity and choosing the same capacity factor for all three technologies. 
From the results and comparative analysis discussed in section 7, it could be concluded that 
the PV-CSP technology is more competitive than CSP technology where the former provided 
11% reduction in LCOE compared to the later. As well as a significant reduction in CapEx 
that represents a reduction of about 40%. The PV-CSP technology provided a better option 
generally, and specifically for the UAE due to the high concentration of aerosols which 
impacts the DNI and has much less impact on GHI and accordingly the PV technology would 
perform better in this case.  
The PV-CCGT provided a highly competitive option with the least LCOE representing 55% 
less than the CSP and 50% less than the PV-CSP technology. The low LCOE achieved by 
the PV-CCGT is mainly due to the very low price of NG used in this study which represents 
the actual cost of NG on the government. This low LCOE comes on the expense of carbon 
emissions were the optimum plant selected resulted in 341 thousand tons of CO2, while 
having a solar share in electricity production of 22%. Higher NG prices has been 
implemented in further sensitivity analysis resulting in a significant rise in the PV-CCGT 
LCOE reaching 136 USD/MWhe, at NG price of 8 USD/MMBtu. 
In baseload optimizations performed without fixing the plant capacity, CSP technology 
converged to capacities ranging between 50 and 150 MW, where lower capacities were 
favored for higher CF and LCOE, and the opposite for lower CF and LCOE. The PV-CSP 
technology optimization converged to the same capacity range as the CSP, while achieving 
higher CF range, with PV/CSP capacity ratio ranging from 0.5 to 1 and higher than 1 for 
higher CF and LCOE. Finally the PV-CCGT technology optimization converged to capacities 
higher than 500 MW, for low LCOE and low SS, and to capacities in the range of 150 to 220 
MW for higher SS and LCOE, while the trade-off was around 400 MW. This is due to the 
significant impact of economy of scale associated with the CCGT block. 
Competitiveness of Renewable energy solutions is highly impacted with fossil fuel prices, 
and accordingly to improve the competitiveness of such technologies and stimulate the 
private sector in contributing in such technologies, reforming energy subsidies is crucial.

10. Suggested Future Improvements 
Finally in this section, some work of improvements will be suggested with regards to the 
developed model and the study in general, that due to time constraints it was not possible to 
include them in this study. 
Model related improvements: 
 
Improve hybridization of PV to be linked to CC and account for ST power 
shortage, which will provide a smooth firm output of the whole plant. 
 
Increase the complexity of the GT and the Rankine bottoming cycle, such as 
optimum steam bleeds, feed water heaters, reheat, and multiple GTs 
integration. 
 
Hybridization through a PID or Iterative feedback controllers aiming for better 
system performance in the hybridization part. 
 
Integration of waste heat recovery systems for desalination or other purposes to 
improve CSP competitiveness, which is a very common application in the region of 
concern of this study.
